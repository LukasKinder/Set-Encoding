eventually , yes . an apple spokesman said the company plans to add official language support in 2012 \u2014 and that will include chinese . but siri won ' t yet be multilingual when the phone hits chinese stores this month .     related :     orangutans go ape for ipads , gorillas not so much     apple design master awarded british knighthood     apple fined in italy , accused of misleading warranties     \u2014 david sarno     photo : a couple look at an iphone in beijing in november . credit : diego azubel / epa \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> computerworld - apple today announced it would start selling the iphone 4s in mainland china a week from this friday -- jan. 13.     the iphone 4s was expected to eventually make it to the people ' s republic of china ( prc ) -- it debuted in hong kong on nov. 11 -- but some analysts had forecast that apple would move faster .     two months ago , brian white of ticonderoga securities said he expected the iphone 4s to reach china before the end of the calendar year .     today , white noted the chinese iphone 4s launch , but maintained that his projection of a faster iphone 4s rollout had come true .     \" as we expected , this represents the fastest iphone launch in apple ' s history with availability in over 90 countries , \" white told clients in a short research note today .     by comparison , apple had placed the iphone 4 in 105 countries by the end of september 2011 , more than a year after its introduction .     apple launched the iphone 4s on oct. 14.     siri , the voice-activated assistant -- and the most-lauded feature of the iphone 4s -- won ' t be able to understand mandarin when the smartphone launches next week , white said . apple today stuck to its previous commitment to bring mandarin comprehension to siri some time this year .     china unicom , the only apple-sanctioned carrier on the mainland , will start selling the iphone 4s on jan. 13 as well .     talk of other chinese mobile carriers , including the country ' s largest , china mobile , remain just that for now . \" we expect china telecom to be added this year and we believe china mobile will eventually become part of the apple ecosystem , \" white said today .     based on the quick sell-out of the iphone 4s in hong kong -- supplies were exhausted within minutes at its one apple store on launch day -- white also anticipates a run on the iphone 4s in the prc . \" we believe the demand for the iphone 4s in mainland china to be unprecedented , \" white said .     china has increasingly been a major factor in apple ' s massive revenues . in the quarter that ended sept. 30 , 2011 , china , taiwan and hong kong generated 16 % of the company ' s total income .     and china , white reminded clients today , is the largest smartphone market in the world .     \" the total mobile phone subscriber base in china was 963.7 million in november , and [ the ] high-end mobile phone market in china is estimated at 100-125 million subscribers or ~$ 70 billion , \" said white .     apple has not revealed prices for the iphone 4s in china , but most experts believe it will carry the same tag as the iphone 4 did in 2010 : 4,999 yuan ( $ 793 ) for the 16gb model and 5,999 yuan ( $ 952 ) for the 32gb model . those prices are sans a long-term carrier contract .     the 8gb iphone 4 , which sells for $ 99 in the u.s. with a two-year contract , goes for 3,880 yuan ( $ 633 ) in china without a contract .     more than 20 other countries -- including bolivia , dominican republic , jamaica , and senegal -- will also see the iphone 4s selling on jan. 13.     gregg keizer covers microsoft , security issues , apple , web browsers and general technology breaking news for computerworld . follow gregg on twitter at @gkeizer , on google+ or subscribe to gregg ' s rss feed . his e-mail address is gkeizer@computerworld.com .     see more articles by gregg keizer .     read more about smartphones in computerworld ' s smartphones topic center .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",

( associated press )     new york ( ap ) \u2014 a powerful nor ' easter could bring blizzard conditions and more than a foot of snow to some parts of the northeast , proving that winter is not done yet .     the national weather service issued a blizzard watch from late monday night through tuesday evening for new york city and parts of northern new jersey and southern connecticut , while winter storm warnings and watches were issued for the remainder of the northeast .     meteorologists said the storm could dump 12 to 18 inches of snow on new york city with wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph .     mayor bill de blasio urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel and help keep the roads clear for sanitation crews and first responders .     \" we ' re preparing for a significant storm on tuesday , and new yorkers should also prepare for snow and dangerous road conditions , \" de blasio said .     light snow is expected to begin late monday night and intensify overnight into early tuesday morning . the heaviest snowfall is expected tuesday morning through the afternoon , with snowfall rates of as much as 2 to 4 inches per hour .     \" this would certainly be the biggest snowstorm of the 2017 winter season in new york city , \" said faye barthold , a weather service meteorologist based on long island .     boston also could get 12 to 18 inches , with isolated amounts of up to 2 feet across northeastern massachusetts .     in philadelphia , crews began treating some area roadways on sunday . the city could see 6 to 12 inches of snow . the weather service said there is a chance the snow could change over to a wintry mix or rain for a time tuesday morning , which could limit total snowfall amounts .     farther south , in the nation ' s capital , where the national cherry blossom festival is scheduled to start wednesday , snow accumulations of 6 to 10 inches are expected .     winter ' s last hurrah arrives just a week after the region saw temperatures climb in the 60s .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>editor ' s note : this story has been updated with new forecast information .     it \u2019 s been a tough winter for snow lovers . from chicago to new england , february was actually hot in many parts of country . daffodils and flowering trees have been blooming for weeks . so far in 2017 , it \u2019 s been in the 60s or 70s as often as it \u2019 s snowed in new york city .     that \u2019 s all about to change this week .     one of the biggest march snowstorms on record appears poised to strike the east coast on monday night , packing strong winds and snow drifts measured in feet . it \u2019 s as if mother nature decided to make up for lost time and pack an entire season \u2019 s worth of winter into a single day .     a blizzard warning is now in effect for a large swath of the northeast from philadelphia to portland , maine , including new york city \u2014 meaning white-out conditions and tropical-storm-force winds are likely . a relatively sharp cutoff between snow and slush should keep the biggest snow totals away from washington , d.c. and boston , but elsewhere , totals will rack up to 1 or 2 feet . the latest national weather service forecasts show a wide section of the northeast , from maryland to maine , on tap for more than a foot of snow . snowflakes should start monday evening around washington , d.c. and reach their peak early morning on tuesday in new york city before tapering off by tuesday evening across new england . the storm will be a relatively fast-mover , with most of its energy concentrated into a period of about nine hours of heavy snow and strong winds at each location .     besides heavy snow and strong winds gusting to nearly hurricane-force in parts of massachusetts , the storm may bring at least moderate coastal flooding to parts of the new jersey shore . the result will be a snow day for sure on tuesday with schools and workplaces closed \u2014 the national weather service is warning that \u201cseveral roads may become impassable \u201d and those that travel should bring along a \u201cwinter survival kit. \u201d nyc schools will be closed ; the governor of connecticut has issued a statewide travel ban . with leaves already out due to the early spring , there \u2019 s also a risk of widespread power outages . an experimental winter storm severity index used by the national weather service maxes out the scale :     while the effects on land may be astounding for at least a short while \u2014 words like paralyzing and crippling are being used to describe it \u2014 meteorologists are also viewing the storm as eye candy and refer to its weather maps as \u201c art . \u201d     from a weather nerd-out standpoint , the storm is close to perfection . the primary ingredients \u2014 a cold pulse from the great lakes and a low-pressure system forming off the carolinas \u2014 will pull in subtropical moisture from a record-warm gulf stream right offshore . the storm will rapidly strengthen \u2014 in the process becoming a meteorological \u201cbomb \u201d ( a technical term for rapidly strengthening low-pressure centers ) \u2014 and travel over the sweet spot to maximize snowfall for new york city and new england . that \u2019 s forced meteorologists to add new colors to their weather maps , and marvel at an \u201c absolute crusher \u201d that will be \u201c puking snow . \u201d an objective pattern-matching algorithm has compared this storm to some of the all-time strongest , too , including the valentine \u2019 s day 2007 blizzard and 1993 \u2019 s \u201cstorm of the century. \u201d     there \u2019 s even a good chance of thundersnow \u2014 the meteorological holy grail , made infamous by a viral weather channel video from 2011 in chicago .     if you \u2019 re wondering , \u201cbut , it \u2019 s march \u2014 how is this happening ? \u201d \u2014 that \u2019 s a good question . if the current forecast \u2014 which was boosted early monday morning by the national weather service \u2014 pans out , the storm will rank as the second-biggest march snowstorm in new york city history ( records go back to 1869 ) . two studies published last year argue that climate change may be making the ingredients for big east coast snowstorms more likely , and the evidence is starting to mount : including this storm , eight of the 10 biggest snowstorms in new york city have occurred since 1996. high-resolution weather models continue to insist that most of this storm \u2019 s snowfall will come during just a few hours via an intense band with snowfall rates of up to 5 inches per hour \u2014 near the upper limit of what is physically possible along the east coast . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",

replacing a death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for \" aggravated homosexuality . \" this includes acts in which one person is infected with hiv , \" serial offenders \" and sex with minors , according to amnesty international .     the law calls for the imprisonment of those who counsel or reach out to gays and lesbians -- a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people .     museveni ' s position on the law changed several times before he signed it .     at one point , he said he wouldn ' t sign the bill , describing homosexuals as \" sick \" people who needed help , not imprisonment .     he said he changed his mind after scientists had determined that there is no gene for homosexuality

a regional military exercise in response to a ugandan law that imposes harsh penalties on homosexuality .     the white house said in a statement the measures were intended to \" reinforce our support for human rights of all ugandans regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity . \"     homosexuality is taboo in most african countries and illegal in 37 , including in uganda where it has been a crime since british rule .     uganda ' s new law , signed by president yoweri museveni in february , imposes jail terms of up to life for \" aggravated homosexuality \" which includes homosexual sex with a minor or while hiv-positive .     widely condemned by donor countries , the law also criminalizes lesbianism for the first time and makes it a crime to help individuals engage in homosexual acts .     western donors , including the united states , had halted or re-directed about $ 118 million in aid to the east african nation ' s economy before thursday ' s announcement .     the white house said on thursday the united states would impose visa restrictions on ugandans it believes have been involved in human rights violations , including gay rights .     the united states will halt $ 2.4 million in funding for a ugandan community policing program in light of a police raid on a u.s.-funded health program at makerere university and reports of people detained and abused while in police custody .     in addition , washington will shift some funding for salaries and travel expenses of ugandan health ministry employees to non-governmental agencies involved in health programs .     it will also reallocate $ 3 million in funding for a planned national public health institute in uganda to another african country , which it did not name . a national institutes of health genomics meeting would be moved from uganda to south africa , the white house said .     it also canceled plans for a u.s.-sponsored military exercise in uganda that was meant to include other east african countries . a date had not yet been set for the exercise .     uganda is a key western ally in the fight against islamic extremism in somalia , where ugandan troops for the backbone of the african union force battling al qaeda-aligned militants .     u.s. special forces have also been involved in the hunt for joseph kony , the elusive rebel commander seeking to topple the ugandan government . kony is believed to be hiding in the jungles of central africa .     in kampala , a government official asked about the u.s. measures said that uganda would not alter its decision to toughen laws against homosexuals .     \" uganda is a sovereign country and can never bow to anybody or be blackmailed by anybody on a decision it took in its interests , even if it involves threats to cut off all financial assistance , \" government spokesman ofwono opondo said .     u.s. president barack obama previously told museveni the law would complicate relations between the two countries . since then washington has been reviewing its funding to uganda , while privately pressing museveni ' s government to repeal the law .

they ' d tell me i was just being awkward . they were right , so there was only one thing for it , cutting out all meat altogether .     so i simply stopped putting it in my mouth . it was that simple . i didn ' t feel any different and what i cooked didn ' t really change as i was a complete povvo and didn ' t bother buying much meat anyway .     to be honest , i was the world ' s worst vegetarian . you see - i didn ' t really like vegetables very much . i ' d spent most of my childhood terrified of them - horrid bland mushy things . it ' s only as an adult i realise that part of the problem is my mother ' s cooking - she hates using salt and has a tendency to over boil things . thanks , mum .     so there we are . a vegetarian who hates vegetables and mostly lives on pasta and cheese . healthy .     fast-forward nearly 15 years and i ' m a father of two and increasingly aware of my diet . my wife stopped her vegetarian ways when pregnancy brought cravings for meat .     with her help ( this makes her sound like my sponsor in fussy eaters anonymous ) i ' d managed to eat more vegetables - by the time our second child was in the womb she was having spinach cravings and i didn ' t complain once about having to eat boiled green leaves every day . for six months . so i was doing better with a wider diet but still no drinking from the meaty cup .     my four-year-old son has the restricted palate that children often have . he mostly refuses to eat anything that isn ' t sausages or fruit , so dining out was becoming difficult . there was the small circle of cheesy carbs i ' d eat , and the intersection with the circle of sausages that my son wants to eat was - well , if you understand your venn diagrams you ' ll know there wasn ' t much in the middle .     it was a trip to hastings that finally did it . at a fish ' n ' chip shop pretty much the only thing on the menu i could eat was a microwaved cheese pasty . i simply couldn ' t face it and ordered fish .     can ' t say i particularly enjoyed it . i found the portion of thick white flesh alarmingly large and i didn ' t want to think about the skin at all . however it did leave me feeling satisfied in a way that i haven ' t felt in a long time . every cell in my body screaming \" protein - that ' s what you need . \"     my wife was very impressed with me . she asked me what i wanted to try next and the thing that had been filling my thoughts since deciding to allow meat back into my life was pepperoni pizza . those little toasted cups of fat that make for a party in the mouth everyone can afford . although to ponce it up a bit we ate it in hampstead . lardy dah .     bacon . let ' s talk about bacon . there ' s no meat more glorious than bacon . you can add it to pasta instead of cheese . you can stick it in a sandwich , er ... instead of cheese . or even rub it on to attract men ( a top tip there ladies ) .     on telling my friends i was eating meat , one looked proud and said , \" welcome back to man club . \" although my new macho credentials were severely dented by the admission that largely i ' d been eating chicken -

the cdc study .     the aoa recommends the following tips to safely wear and care for contact lenses .     visit your eye doctor every year . annual in-person eye examines determine whether or not your prescription changed and evaluate eye and overall health . an optometrist can diagnose eye diseases ( such as glaucoma diabetes strokes     buy your contact lenses from a trusted source . contact lenses and lens care products are medical devices regulated by the fda , yet some online retailers sell them without prescriptions and sometimes ship contact lenses of the wrong prescription . poorly fitted contact lenses can cause significant damage to the eye \u2019 s function , which could lead to irreversible sight loss .     don \u2019 t panic if your lens is \u201clost \u201d in your eye . sometimes rubbing your eyes can cause a contact to move around , but it is not possible for it to get lost behind your eye due to a membrane \u2014 the conjunctiva \u2014 that covers the eye and the inside of the eyelids . if the lens has moved and is not visible , stay calm and instill a few drops of saline solution to moisten the eye , look away from where you feel the lens and lift your eyelid . when you see the lens , use the tip of your finger to remove the lens . if this happens repeatedly , make an appointment with your eye doctor to check the fit of your lenses .     don \u2019 t ever share contacts . sharing contacts means sharing germs and bacteria , which increases the risk of infection and complications . additionally , friend \u2019 s contacts may not be the right size or fit for your eyes leading to serious problems .     never use tap water to clean and rinse lenses . contact solutions remove mucus , secretions , films or deposits that can build up during use and lead to bacterial growth if not removed properly . use the disinfecting solution that your doctor prescribed each night to keep contacts clean and safe . when you find yourself at a last-minute overnight stay and don \u2019 t have your solution , don \u2019 t rely on tap water as it contains bacteria and other microorganisms that have been proven to cause serious eye infections .     keep your lens case clean . after you insert your reusable , disinfected contact lenses , rinse your case with solution , and store it upside down and open to dry fully . every three months , toss your old case and replace it with a fresh , new one .     no matter how tired you are , do not sleep in your contacts . while some lenses are approved for continuous overnight use , sleeping in lenses does increase the risk of an eye infection . if you regularly fall asleep with your lenses in , talk to your optometrist during your next appointment about extended wear contact lenses .

helicopter to rescue him .     the helicopter couldn ' t land . so two police officers dropped down , and one carried lavoie back up on his shoulders . they brought him to hospital .     police say he was rescued just in time .     \" we believe he might have died in a few more hours -- 24 to 48 hours more , \" said sgt . ronald mcinnis , a provincial police spokesman .     \" he ' s in critical condition . he wasn ' t even able to drink water when we offered him some . he will be on an iv for several weeks .     \" he will gradually learn to drink , and then eat , again . \"     the man had lost much of his body weight and was suffering from hypothermia when he was found : \" it ' s already been snowing ( up there ) for two or three weeks . the nights are cold , \" mcinnis said .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>( cnn ) -- if marco lavoie had not been rescued when he was , the quebec man probably would have perished within 48 hours .     he was hypothermic , dehydrated and near starvation in the unforgiving cold of northwestern quebec when police rescued him wednesday .     lavoie ' s survival might be called miraculous , as he had been in the wilderness for more than three months .     the 44-year-old is an experienced outdoorsman , but an encounter with a bear changed his luck , quebec police said     at some point during a planned two-month canoe trek in the lake matagami area , a bear attacked lavoie ' s campsite , eating his food and ruining his equipment , police spokeswoman christine coulombe said .     the bear did not injure lavoie but left him without the tools or resources to survive . police say they have yet to speak with lavoie to get details .     minnesota hiker falls from cliff to his death near yosemite waterfall     \" in these parts , there ' s a subculture of people who go on these long trips into the middle of nowhere , but sometimes we forgot how dangerous it can be , \" gerald lemoine , mayor of a small town near matagami , told the montreal gazette .     the rescued canoeist began his adventure july 16 , coulombe said . it wasn ' t until three months later , on october 21 , that his family called authorities because too long had passed without lavoie ' s return .     police conducted searches for eight days , weather permitting , with no luck .     rescuers in a helicopter finally spotted lavoie on wednesday , but they could not safely land at that spot , coulombe said . so officers had to hike in to pick him up and carry him more than a mile to the chopper .     lavoie ' s condition was such that he was barely able to speak and at first couldn ' t even drink water , the gazette reported .     had he spent another day or two in the elements , he would have starved to death , police spokesman ronald mcinnis said .     the man had lost half of his body weight , he said .     it was lavoie ' s german shepherd who scared the bear away on the day of the attack , but the dog did not survive the ordeal , mcinnis said .     \" up there , in the canadian shield , there ' s little plant life to live off , so he would have been slowly , painfully dying when they found him . it ' s an amazing feat that he was able to keep himself alive this long with almost no equipment , \" survival instructor caleb musgrave told the gazette .     \" when you start to go hungry , you get mood swings , your mind breaks , and you cramp up all over your body . eventually , your body will start cannibalizing itself , eating away at the fat in your organs and then in your muscles . it takes someone who won ' t give up in the face of that , \" he added .     woman carries stranded , wounded pit bill down mountain \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> montreal \u2014 outdoorsman marco lavoie , rescued wednesday after three months in the deep woods near james bay , made the heartbreaking decision to kill and eat his beloved german shepherd to stay alive .     a source close to the amazing story told qmi agency that lavoie , 44 , sacrificed his dog when he became stranded at the nottaway river , roughly 800 km northwest of montreal .     a bear had eaten lavoie ' s food and destroyed his boat in mid-july , leaving him alone with the dog .     a few days after the bear attack , the person who spoke to qmi on condition of anonymity said lavoie used a rock to kill his dog before eating the pet .     by the time provincial police airlifted him out three months later , lavoie was barely able to speak or eat . he suffered hypothermia and dehydration and had lost about 90 pounds .     survival expert andre francois bourbeau said lavoie did what he could to live .     \" he survived because he made \u008bgood decisions . eating his dog was one of them , \" said bourbeau , author of a survival guide .     bourbeau has researched hundreds of similar stories , some of which include cannibalism .     \" you have to be desperate , but there ' s no shame in ( eating the dog ) , \" said bourbeau . \" he had to use reason . \"     the survival expert says that after 30 days in the wilderness with no food , lavoie ' s body would have gone into shock from starvation .     \" hunger squeezes you so much that you would accept food that ' s not normally possible , \" said bourbeau . \" you can crave slugs and bugs . \"     lavoie is an experienced hiker who often spent weeks in the wilderness by himself . but the nottaway river is considered too dangerous even for the hardiest outdoorsmen .     andre diamond , a waswanipi cree who lives on an island at the mouth of the river , said he warned lavoie to stay away .     \" he said it didn ' t scare him , but it ' s not a river to travel alone , \" said diamond . \" other adventurers have gone there over 20 , 30 years and never came back . \"     sydney ottereyes , a local cree who was part of the lavoie search party , said the river is downright dangerous .     \" it ' s a complicated river with lots of rocks , \" said ottereyes . \" in some places , there ' s plenty of water while elsewhere there ' s none . the wind comes and there can be up to three currents in the same place . \"     lavoie is currently hospitalized in \" very serious \" condition . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> a hiker was rescued after surviving a bear attack and spending three months , exposed to snow and freezing temperatures , in a remote corner of northern canada , police said .     police located marco lavoie , 44 , in the wilderness near waskaganish , quebec , on wednesday , 10 days after his family reported him missing and nearly a month after the experienced outdoorsman was expected to return from a two month hiking expedition .     police believe lavoie survived the bear attack uninjured , sometime in august , when his german shepherd got in between the man and the bear , sgt . ronald mcinnis , spokesman for the quebec provincial police told abcnews.com .     \" the bear ate the man ' s food and damaged his survival equipment , \" said mcinnis , \" but his dog went between the man and the bear and protected him . the man was not injured in the attack . \"     mcinnis would not say what became of the dog and would not comment on reports that lavoie may have eaten the dog to survive .     lavoie suffered \" hypothermia , dehydration and starvation , \" police said , but he is expected to survive his injuries .     the hunt for lavoie was initially hampered by heavy snow and high winds that grounded helicopters on oct. 21 , but on oct. 30 a chopper crew spotted lavoie and officers were dropped in the area that was described by mcinnis as \" wild . \"     lavoie was too weak to walk , and a qpp officer carried the man on his back for nearly two miles to the helicopter , a trip that due to snow and rugged terrain took three hours , mcinnis said .     cops believed the man would have been dead within hours had he not been rescued . he was too weak to eat or drink water and is receiving fluids via iv .     police are waiting for the man to further recover in order to continue their interview and learn exactly why he was unable to escape the wilderness and the measures he took to survive . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",

( matt mcclain/ the washington post )     the trump administration has instructed officials at the environmental protection agency to freeze its grants and contracts , a move that could affect everything from state-led climate research to localized efforts to improve air and water quality to environmental justice projects aimed at helping poor communities .     an email went out to employees in the agency \u2019 s office of acquisition management within hours of president trump \u2019 s swearing-in on friday .     \u201cnew epa administration has asked that all contract and grant awards be temporarily suspended , effective immediately , \u201d read the email , which was shared with the washington post . \u201cuntil we receive further clarification , which we hope to have soon , please construe this to include task orders and work assignments. \u201d     according to its website , each year the epa awards more than $ 4 billion in funding for grants and other assistance agreements . for now , it appears , that funding is on hold , casting a cloud of uncertainty over one of the agency \u2019 s core functions , as well as over the scientists , state and local officials , universities and native american tribes that often benefit from the grants .     president trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing the u.s. from the trans-pacific partnership trade deal , an order establishing a federal hiring freeze and a third order reinstating the \" mexico city policy , \" on jan. 23 at the white house . ( reuters )     \u201cepa staff have been reviewing grants and contracts information with the incoming transition team , \u201d an agency spokesperson said in an email tuesday . \u201cpursuant to that review , the agency is continuing to award the environmental program grants and state revolving loan fund grants to the states and tribes ; and we are working to quickly address issues related to other categories of grants. \u201d the agency said the goal is to complete the grants and contracts review by the close of business friday .     it is unclear whether the move by the incoming administration was related to president trump \u2019 s order monday that federal agencies halt hiring in all areas on the executive branch except for the military , national security and public safety , which also curbed contracting as a way of compensating for the freeze . \u201ccontracting outside the government to circumvent the intent of this memorandum shall not be permitted , \u201d the memorandum states .     [ trump \u2019 s regulatory freeze halts four obama rules aimed at promoting greater energy efficiency ]     administration officials inserted the language in an apparent attempt to curb the growth in federal contracts that arose during previous freezes imposed under presidents jimmy carter and ronald reagan . but the total halt in contracts and grants for a single agency appeared to go beyond that specific provision , which applied solely to contracting activities in response to the halt in hiring .     myron ebell , who oversaw the epa transition for the new administration , told propublica on monday that the freezing of grants and contracts was not unprecedented .     \u201cthey \u2019 re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don \u2019 t want to have happen , so any regulations going forward , contracts , grants , hires , they want to make sure to look at them first , \u201d said ebell , director of the center for energy and environment at the competitive enterprise institute , an industry-backed group that has long sought to slash the authority of the epa .     \u201cthis may be a little wider than some previous administrations , but it \u2019 s very similar to what others have done , \u201d he told the publication .     but not in recent history has such a blanket freeze taken place , and one employee told propublica he did not recall anything like it in nearly a decade with the agency .     the move is likely to increase anxieties inside an already tense agency . ebell and other transition officials have made little secret about their goal of greatly reducing the epa \u2019 s footprint and regulatory reach . trump has repeatedly criticized the epa for what he calls a string of onerous , expensive regulations that are hampering businesses . and his nominee to run the agency , oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt , has repeatedly sued the epa over the years , challenging its legal authority to regulate everything from

agency , a move that could affect a significant part of the agency \u2019 s budget allocations and even threaten to disrupt core operations ranging from toxic cleanups to water quality testing , according to records and interviews .     in one email exchange obtained by propublica on monday , an epa contracting officer concluded a note to a storm water management employee this way :     \u201cright now we are in a holding pattern . the new epa administration has asked that all contract and grant awards be temporarily suspended , effective immediately . until we receive further clarification , this includes task orders and work assignments. \u201d     asked about any possible freeze and its implications , epa officials did not provide an answer .     one epa employee aware of the freeze said he had never seen anything like it in nearly a decade with the agency . hiring freezes happened , he said , but freezes on grants and contracts seemed extraordinary . the employee said the freeze appeared to be nationwide , and as of monday night it was not clear for how long it would be in place .     the substance of the email exchange was confirmed by one senior epa employee with over 20 years at the agency . an epa lawyer also said that earlier communications had described such a freeze .     monday night , myron ebell , who ran the epa transition for the incoming administration , confirmed the basics of the freeze , but said the actions were not unprecedented .     \u201cthey \u2019 re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don \u2019 t want to have happen , so any regulations going forward , contracts , grants , hires , they want to make sure to look at them first , \u201d said ebell , who returned over the weekend to his position directing energy and global warming policy at the competitive enterprise institute , a free-market , industry-aligned group that has long fought the epa \u2019 s growth and influence .     \u201cthis may be a little wider than some previous administrations , but it \u2019 s very similar to what others have done , \u201d he said .     president trump has nominated oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt to head the epa . pruitt has deep ties to the fossil fuel industry , and formed an alliance between the industry and other attorneys general to fight former president baracks obama \u2019 s climate proposals . he is seen as a hero among conservatives who believe the epa oversteps its federal authority .     pruitt faced tough questioning and even outright skepticism during his initial confirmation hearing last week . the washington examiner published a statement monday by tom carper , the delaware democrat and ranking member on the environment and public works committee , saying , \" following the committee hearing on scott pruitt ' s nomination to head the epa , serious questions remain about the nominee ' s record and vision for the agency he seeks to lead . \"     much about any freeze at the epa remains unclear , including whether it affects only new grants and contracts , or may also affect the roughly $ 6.4 billion worth of federal contracts the epa already has in place . epa press offices across the country did not immediately respond to calls and emails requesting comment .     the epa routinely contracts out services ranging from hazardous waste handling to drinking water quality testing . more than 600 active contracts with businesses ranging from small minority-owned consulting companies to institutions as big as colorado state university can be explored here .     the environmental agency \u2019 s grants are used to support private , state and municipal level environmental testing , remediation and innovation projects . together those programs can total more in spending than an entire year \u2019 s budget for the agency . the epa awarded roughly $ 1.4 billion worth of contracts and $ 9.6 billion in grants in 2013 , the latest year for which data was available , according to the government spending website insidegov.com . the agency \u2019 s total budget in 2016 was $ 8.6 billion .     a freeze on payments would appear consistent with other actions taken on monday , including president trump signing an executive order instituting a hiring freeze for new federal workers \u2014 a centerpiece of the pledge he made in his \u201ccontract with the american voter \u201d during the presidential campaign .     if anyone has more information on recent events at the epa , please contact us .     abrahm lustgarten

( associated press )     the pilots made history thursday , first matching and then surpassing the 5,209-mile ( 8,383-kilometer ) official world distance record for human flight in a gas balloon . their next milestone is a 1978 duration record of 137 hours , 5 minutes and 50 seconds in the air in a traditional gas balloon \u2014 a mark that ' s considered the \" holy grail \" of ballooning achievements . the two eagles team expected to surpass that friday morning .     they hope to land saturday somewhere on the peninsula of baja california , where volunteer chase crews were being organized to help with the landing .     the balloon team originally planned to cross into north america in canada but shifted the plans because of changing weather . they are now catching a wind pattern that will take them south toward mexico .     the balloon was about 400 miles northwest of san francisco when it hit the distance mark . everyone inside the control room had their smartphones pointed at the screen to document the moment .     \" there it is ! there it is ! \" shouted team members at the flight ' s mission control in albuquerque as a giant screen showed the helium-filled two eagles balloon passing the record set by the double eagle v in 1981.     in a matter of hours , they hit another milestone in similar fashion when they reached the 5,260-mile mark . that ' s the distance \u2014 1 percent more than the current record \u2014 they needed to meet in their quest to establish a record under international aviation rules .     the distance still has to be confirmed by the federation aeronautique internationale , a process that can take weeks .     \" we ' re not taking any time to celebrate , \" said steve shope , head of mission control . \" we have a lot of work we have to do , and we ' re just taking this flight one hour at a time . \"     the two eagles pilots , troy bradley of albuquerque and leonid tiukhtyaev of russia , are aiming to set both distance and duration records with their flight from saga , japan , which began shortly before 6 : 30 a.m. sunday japan time .     the duration record was set in 1978 when ben abruzzo , maxie anderson and larry newman made the first trans-atlantic balloon flight .     the pilots had been aiming for canada until a high-pressure ridge formed off the u.s. west coast , forcing a sweeping right turn toward mexico , where they now plan to land on saturday .     the shifting weather patterns resulted in a flurry of decision-making that made for a hard night for the pilots and mission control . shope said the pilots were in better spirits thursday after getting some sleep , but he acknowledged that being on oxygen for that many days and the high altitude can take a physical toll .     because weather conditions vary at different altitudes , the pilots traded speed and altitude throughout thursday so the balloon would track to the south .     \" it ' s a pretty sophisticated dance up there , \" said ray bair , a member of the mission control team .     the balloon is outfitted with an array of monitors and other instruments that are tracking its course and compiling data to be submitted to the record-keepers . with a massive , helium-filled envelope and a specially-designed carbon fiber-composite capsule , it was designed to stay aloft for up to 10 days , but the loss of gas and ballast has shortened that time by a couple of days .     the last task will be a safe landing .     sand dunes along the peninsula were looking like the best option , bair said . there are more favorable spots immediately along the mexican coast , but then come the mountains .     ___     online :     http://pacificballoon.com/tracking/index.php     https://twitter.com/twoeaglesteam

sits beneath a huge helium-filled envelope and is designed to stay aloft for up to 10 days . the pilots live in a closet-like space with a very low ceiling .     image copyright ap image caption the

image caption the balloon is set to land in mexico after weather conditions changed the flight plan     on thursday , the two eagles team tweeted : \" the pilots have just surpassed the distance needed to set a new record . 5,261 miles or 8,467km . \"     \" we ' re not taking any time to celebrate , ' ' said head of mission control steve shope .     \" we have a lot of work we have to do , and we ' re just taking this flight one hour at a time . \"     on its website , the team says two eagles will not have officially broken the records until documentation is approved by the us national aeronautic association followed by the federation aeronautique internationale - a process that could take several weeks or months .     in 1978 , three pilots made the first trans-atlantic balloon flight in 137 hours , 5 minutes and 50 seconds , setting the duration record in the process .     americans ben abruzzo , maxie anderson , and larry newman travelled on the double eagle ii balloon from presque isle , maine , to miserey , france , about 60 miles ( 95km ) northwest of paris .     the double eagle ii gondola is displayed at the smithsonian national air and space museum annex at washington dulles international airport .     two eagles facts     the two eagles craft is a helium-filled gas balloon . \" roziere balloons \" , which use both hot-air and gas , are the only ones that have circled the earth .     depending on weather conditions , the balloon flies between 12,000 to 30,000 feet ( 9,100m ) above the ground     the craft is about five feet ( 150cm ) wide , seven feet long , and five feet high , weighing only 220 pounds ( 100kg ) .     the balloon started its journey carrying about 11,000 pounds of sand for ballast     in 1981 , the double eagle v was the first gas balloon to successfully cross the pacific ocean and set the existing distance record .     crew members mr abruzzo , mr newman , ron clark and rocky aoki made it from nagashima , japan , to mendocino national forest in california in 84 hours and 31 minutes .     the current team named its craft in honour of the existing record holders .     two eagles can stay in the air for a maximum of 10 days ; it is now day five of the journey .     at the moment , it is not clear exactly where the two eagles balloon will land .     the team had been aiming for canada but a ride of high-pressure ridge off the us west coast forced the balloon into a sweeping right turn toward mexico .     a network of balloon enthusiasts has been organised to act as chase crews , but correspondents say it remains unclear if the balloon will be able to land in a place where a ground crew can help them . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given

( associated press )     seattle ( ap ) \u2014 a tax on large companies such as amazon that was meant to fight a growing homelessness crisis got rolled back during a raucous seattle city council meeting that exposed divisions over how much companies that have fueled booming economies should help pay to alleviate the downsides of success .     a divided crowd chanted , jeered and booed at the meeting , drowning out city leaders as they cast a 7-2 vote tuesday . people shouted , \" stop the repeal , \" as others unfurled a large red banner that read , \" tax amazon . \" an opposing group held \" no tax on jobs \" signs .     the vote showed amazon ' s ability to aggressively push back on government taxes , especially in its affluent hometown where it ' s the largest employer with more than 45,000 workers and where it has been criticized for contributing to a widening income gap .     it remains to be seen whether seattle ' s retreat will have a chilling effect on other cities considering taxes on big tech companies to help mitigate the effects of growth .     the city council in mountain view , california , where google is based , will vote june 26 on whether to put a similar measure before voters in november . the \" google tax , \" which has unanimous support from the council , aims to alleviate transportation woes and high housing costs in the silicon valley city south of san francisco .     mountain view mayor lenny siegel said seattle ' s about-face hasn ' t changed his support for the tax , the details of which the council and city administrators have been working on for several months .     \" it appears that we have a better relationship with our business than seattle does , \" siegel said .     he said google hasn ' t taken a position on the proposal and that no \" groundswell \" of opposition has materialized from the internet search giant and other companies .     \" that doesn ' t mean they support it , \" siegel said . \" our chamber of commerce has not been excited by it . \"     in seattle , the tax was proposed as a progressive revenue source aimed at tackling one of the nation ' s highest homelessness numbers , a problem that hasn ' t eased even as city spending on the issue grew .     businesses and residents demanded more accountability in how seattle funds homelessness and housing and said the city should take a regional approach to the problem . many worried that amazon and others would leave the city as the companies sharply criticized the tax .     amazon called tuesday ' s vote \" the right decision for the region ' s economic prosperity . \"     the company is \" deeply committed to being part of the solution to end homelessness in seattle , \" drew herdener , an amazon vice president , said in a statement .     city leaders underestimated the frustration and anger from residents , businesses and others over not just a tax increase but also a growing sense that homelessness appears to have gotten worse , not better , despite seattle spending millions to fight it .     it poured $ 68 million into the effort last year and plans to spend more this year . the tax would have raised roughly $ 48 million annually .     but a one-night count in january found more than 12,000 homeless people in the seattle and surrounding region , a 4 percent increase from the previous year . the region saw 169 homeless deaths last year .     many supporters called the repeal a betrayal and said the tax was a step toward building badly needed affordable housing . they booed council members , imploring them to keep it and fight a coalition of businesses trying to get a referendum overturning the tax on the november ballot .     \" it ' s frustrating to see the council be so spineless when the city has so much leverage for businesses to come here despite the tax , \" said jake lindsay , 25 , a musician and lyft driver who supported the tax .     several council members , including three who sponsored the legislation but voted to repeal it , lamented the reversal and conceded they didn ' t have the resources or time to fight the referendum .     councilwoman lisa herbold said it \" was truly our best option \" and that she repealed it with a heavy heart . she lashed out at business interests for blaming the problems on government inefficiencies .     seattle ' s so-called head tax would have charged companies about $ 275 per full-time worker each year for affordable housing and homeless services . it targeted nearly 600 businesses making at least $ 20 million in gross revenue and would have taken effect next year .     days after it passed , the business-backed no tax on jobs campaign began gathering signatures for the ballot and raised more than $ 280,000 in cash contributions in just weeks .     in silicon valley , siegel , the mountain view mayor , said google and other companies such as linkedin that are based in the california city acknowledge that soaring housing costs and long commutes make it harder to recruit and retain workers .     he said city officials estimate the tax would raise about $ 10 million annually once it ' s completely phased in after three years . google is expected to pay half .     siegel said public meetings that touched on the issue were \" moderately \" attended , and the proposal does not appear to be as contentious in mountain view as in seattle .     ___     associated press reporter paul elias in san francisco contributed to this report . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> seattle repeals tax on big business after opposition from amazon , starbucks     enlarge this image toggle caption ted s. warren/ap ted s. warren/ap     in a victory for amazon , the seattle city council voted to repeal a tax on the city ' s biggest businesses tuesday , a measure designed to fund efforts to combat seattle ' s large homeless population .     in a meeting punctured with shouting from activists , council members voted 7-2 to repeal the so-called \" head tax , \" which would have raised about $ 47 million per year to fund affordable housing projects and to help the city ' s homeless population .     it was a sharp reversal from just last month , when the council voted unanimously to pass the tax and the city ' s mayor signed it into law .     amazon , starbucks and other companies then funded a campaign against the tax and to put it on a referendum to voters in november .     council member lisa herbold said the groups opposing the tax had \" unlimited resources \" and that her vote to repeal was \" counter to my values as a person . \"     however , a campaign from business groups including the chamber of commerce had convinced most seattle residents to oppose the tax and \" we don ' t have the time and we don ' t have the resources necessary to change enough minds , \" herbold said .     \" this is not a winnable battle at this time , \" she added .     seattle ' s government said the tax would only affect about 3 percent of the city ' s employers \u2014 those grossing at least $ 20 million each year . about 585 employers would have paid about $ 275 per employee per year , according to the city council .     amazon has about 45,000 employees in seattle and is the city ' s largest private employer . it would have paid about $ 12 million per year .     amazon ' s ceo jeff bezos was named the world ' s richest man by forbes in march , with a worth of $ 112 billion .     the company said the vote \" to repeal the tax on job creation is the right decision for the region ' s economic prosperity . \"     amazon , starbucks and investment company vulcan each paid $ 25,000 toward the referendum effort , kuow reports . the no tax on jobs campaign raised $ 350,000 .     after the session to consider repealing the law was announced a day earlier , seattle ' s chamber of commerce said it was a \" breath of fresh air . \" the chamber echoed language from amazon that it was a \" tax on jobs . \"     \" from day one , the seattle metro chamber has been clear that a tax on jobs is not the way to address the regional homelessness crisis , \" president and ceo marilyn strickland said in a statement monday .     the law passed in may was itself a watered-down version of the original plan , to tax companies $ 500 per employee . amazon temporarily halted construction of a tower in downtown seattle in opposition .     seattle mayor jenny durkan said she would sign the repeal into law . \" instead of engaging in a prolonged , expensive political fight , the city and i will continue to move forward on building real partnerships that align our strategies from business , advocates , philanthropy , \" she said in a statement .     council members teresa mosqueda and kshama sawant both voted against the repeal . sawant called it a \" cowardly betrayal of the needs of working people , \" saying it was \" capitulation and it ' s a betrayal . \"     critics of the tax reportedly saw the city ' s homeless problem growing , despite large amounts of spending by the city already . seattle spent $ 68 million on fighting homelessness in 2017 , according to the associated press .     the city council said 8,522 people were counted as \" experiencing homelessness \" in seattle in 2017. including nearby areas , that number went up to 12,000 during a one-night count in january , the ap says , which is up 4 percent from the year before . the wire service says 169 homeless people died in 2017.     kuow reports that the characterization of the tax as \" extra money for homelessness ... wasn ' t necessarily an accurate representation . \"     \" it ' s possible the money wouldn ' t have been extra : it could have plugged a future hole in the budget instead . seattle had already been spending money from its construction boom on homelessness . with a depleted general fund projected to sink into the red , the city needed to find money just to stay afloat . \"     \" i ' m very supportive of the homeless , \" small business owner claudia campanile told the station . \" but i am not supportive of the constituency getting taxed with no representation and no clear game plan of what they ' re going to do with the funds . \"     the mayor seemed to address that concern in her statement tuesday , saying , \" people deserve to know how their money is being spent and what is working . the city has worked towards increased accountability and transparency with taxpayer dollars expected to be spent on the homelessness crisis . \"     cities across the country are competing to host amazon ' s proposed second headquarters . the company says it would create 50,000 jobs and would invest $ 5 billion in the city it chooses \u2014 leading some competing for the headquarters to promise billions in tax breaks for the corporate behemoth . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",

        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~> image copyright reuters image caption nearly 10 million people took the gaokao exam in china last week     a us university will begin accepting the chinese university entrance exam known as the gaokao in an effort to attract more chinese students .     the university of new hampshire will be the first state university in the us to accept the standardised placement test .     china is the largest exporter of students to the us , with 377,000 currently enrolled in us universities , according to government data .     an estimated 10 million students took the nine-hour test in china last week .     the exam - which takes place over two days in june each year - is taken by nearly every chinese pupil and plays a crucial role in determining a person ' s career and future prospects .     a ' life-defining ' test     howard zhang , bbc chinese service editor     gaokao literally means high exam . it refers to the annual national higher education entrance exam in china , similar in format to the sat in the united states .     millions of chinese high school seniors who sit through this highly competitive multi-subject exams each year see it as a life-defining moment .     graduates who make it into top universities often end up in top companies and with good careers . those who fail to enter university are often condemned to a life with little prospects .     almost 10 million students sat through this year ' s gaokao ; one out of four won ' t end up with a university place .     the gaokao predates modern times , having its roots in imperial china .     the university of new hampshire had 781 international undergraduate and graduate students on campus last fall , according to the union leader newspaper - double the figure from five years previous .     about half of those foreign students - 357 - came from china .     as part of the new initiative , the university has launched a recruiting website in chinese and english .     \" this initiative is part of unh ' s commitment to attracting more and stronger applicants from around the world , \" said university spokeswoman erika mantz .     \" this new programme will in no way limit access for new hampshire students , \" she added .     image copyright reuters image caption the students see huge public support during the gaokao season - here some are being cheered on their way to sit the tests in anhui     in addition to submitting their gaokao results , students must also take an english test , participate in a video interview and send their high school transcripts before moving forward with the application process .     ms mantz added that the process was still being finalised , but that chinese students may still need to take the american sat or act exam .     students who are accepted will be able to begin classes in durham this january , allowing them to start a semester early .     previously , students from china would have had to wait for a new application period to begin in the autumn , putting them behind the rest of the first-year class .     a similar programme at the university of san francisco , a jesuit college , allows chinese students to bypass us standardised tests altogether and instead submit just their gaokao score , grades , and english language interview .     image copyright bbc/ gaokao image caption a maths question on the 2014 exam asks : \" if a= { } , and b={ } , then a i b = ( ) \"     up to three percent of chinese students bypass the gaokao by paying to for an \" international track \" programme , which prepares them for standardised testing abroad .     international enrolment - in which students are required to pay full priced tuition - helps universities bolster revenue .     the university of new hampshire charges $ 45,000 ( \u00a3 34,000 ) per academic year for tuition and housing costs .     media playback is unsupported on your device media caption chinese students explain why they came to the us - and how college life differs to home     dozens of universities in europe , australia , and canada already accept gaokao results on applications .     the us university ' s decision comes amid a federal crackdown on chinese student visas .     the trump administration announced in march that it is considering limiting the visas as part of a broad package of measures against china , which the us accuses of violating american intellectual-property laws .     the goal , the white house says , is to reduce \" economic theft by non-traditional intelligence collectors \" .     details have not been officially announced , but students studying high tech manufacturing fields , such as aviation and robotics , are expected to now receive visas with shorter lengths of stay .     the associated press reported in late may that us consulates have been directed by the department of state to now only issue chinese students with one-year - rather than five-year - visas . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>hong kong \u2014 every june , millions of high school seniors in china sit down for a grueling university entrance exam , knowing they may not get into a top school or any school at all . if their results are disappointing , finding another route to university can take a year or more .     now they may have a faster option .     the university of new hampshire says it will start accepting scores from the chinese exam , making it the first flagship state school in the united states to evaluate chinese applicants using the results from that test , known as the gaokao .     there are 377,000 chinese students in the united states , representing more than one third of all international students , according to the federal government . since they often pay full tuition , they are an important source of revenue for american universities , which have been intensifying their efforts to recruit chinese students .     erika mantz , a spokeswoman for the university of new hampshire , said the gaokao program was meant to attract \u201coutstanding chinese high school graduates \u201d after they get their test results in late june , months after the deadline has passed under the regular admissions process . most incoming freshmen would have been admitted by the time chinese students take the gaokao test . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> our innovative gaokao-based , early admission program for superlative chinese students     the university of san francisco is pleased to announce that we are now accepting applications for our admission by gaokao examination program for the fall 2018 semester .     we started this innovative program to enable chinese students who score well on the gaokao taken in june to study in the united states as early as the coming fall semester ( august 2018 ) .     students will be admitted to usf based on their gaokao test scores , school record and a one-on-one english interview with usf professors via zoom . there are no other admission requirements .     usf president paul j. fitzgerald , s.j . explained :     many studies have shown that the sat is not a very good predictor of how well students will do at university . we are aware of the many criticisms that have been made of the gaokao , but it has the advantage of being what educational experts call a ' criterion-referenced ' exam : it tests whether students are able to master a given body of knowledge , as well as their ability to work hard and consistently .     usf recognizes this and wants to give excellent chinese students the opportunity to start their education in the usa , immediately \u2014 without spending an extra year preparing for ielts , toefl or sat tests .     eligible student scores will be established after gaokao results become available in the third week of june . the interviews will begin july 2 ( monday ) and will be held via zoom .     successful candidates will be able to start their studies in america as soon as august of this year .     the admission process will be streamlined so that qualified students will receive formal admission letters within days of their successful personal interviews , enabling them to schedule visa appointments . this will allow them to arrive in time for the beginning of classes on tuesday , august 21.

weekday mornings .     / updated by alex johnson     at least seven lawsuits alleging saudi government support and funding for the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks have landed in federal courts in the six months since congress opened the door to such litigation over the fierce opposition of former president barack obama .     a suit consolidating some of those actions was filed monday in u.s. district court in manhattan , representing the families and estates of about 800 of the 2,996 people killed in the attacks .     it alleges that the saudi government helped pay for the operation through its alleged funding of al-qaeda terrorist camps and its logistical support for the group ' s transport of weapons , people and money around the world .     the suit , which doesn ' t specify damages , alleges that the money and support were channeled through nine saudi government-supported charities \u2014 including the saudi red crescent authority , part of the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies .     few if any of the allegations , many of which mirror accusations in other lawsuits filed since september , appear to be new , but they add details to the assertions of 9/11 victims ' families that elements of the saudi government , one of the united states ' closest allies in the middle east , secretly backed the attacks .     for example , the consolidated suit alleges that officials in saudi embassies helped some of the hijackers find homes and learn english so they could pass unnoticed in the united states .     it alleges that saudi authorities even applied a secret code to the passports of al-qaeda members to facilitate their international travel and that such codes were discovered on the passports of at least three of the 9/11 terrorists .     the lawsuits began rushing into the courts after sept. 28 , when congress overrode obama ' s veto of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act , or jasta , which provided an exemption to the legal principle of sovereign immunity so families could take the saudi government to court .     firefighters and rescue workers undrape a large u.s. flag near a damaged area of the pentagon on sept. 12 , 2001. larry downing / reuters     the obama administration argued that providing the exemption would set a dangerous precedent , opening the door for other countries and their citizens to haul the united states into court .     most of the actions brought since the veto was overridden are on behalf of families of victims of the attack on the world trade center . one was brought by insurance companies seeking to recoup some of their losses .     on friday , a u.s. magistrate judge in manhattan ordered lawyers for the plaintiffs and for saudi arabia to appear in court this thursday to try to work out a way to coordinate the various cases .     a representative for the kingdom of saudi arabia could not be reached for comment on monday evening . country officials in

seeking to hold saudi arabia accountable for 9/11 , the families of 800 victims have filed a lawsuit accusing the saudis of complicity in the worst terror attacks on american soil .     the legal action , filed in federal court in manhattan , details a scenario of involvement by saudi officials who are said to have aided some of the hijackers before the attacks .     fifteen of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals and three of them had previously worked for the kingdom .     the document details how officials from saudi embassies supported hijackers salem al-hazmi and khalid al-mihdhar 18 months before 9/11 .     the officials allegedly helped them find apartments , learn english and obtain credit cards and cash . the documents state that the officials helped them learn how to blend into the american landscape .     the suit also produces evidence that officials in the saudi embassy in germany supported lead hijacker mohamed atta . it claims that a saudi official was in the same hotel in virginia with several hijackers the night before the attacks .     many of the revelations in the lawsuit are culled from findings of an fbi investigation into the terrorist attacks . the suit filed by aviation law firm kreindler &amp; kreindler claims some of the hijackers had special markers in their passports , identifying them as al-qaida sympathizers .     the lawsuit asserts that the saudi royals , who for years had been trying to curry favor with fundamentalists to avoid losing power , were aware that funds from saudi charities were being funneled to al-qaida .     aviation attorney jim kreindler told pix11 news : \u201cthe charities were alter egos of the saudi government. \u201d     the lawsuit spells out how money was transferred from charities in saudi arabia to the terror group .     charities the lawsuit claims fronted for al-qaida include the al-haramain islamic foundation , an organization that was designated by the u.s. as a sponsor of terrorism .     kreindler maintains that there was a direct link between all the charities and osama bin laden and that they operated with the full knowledge of saudi officials .     the legal document claims that the saudis used a variety of means to conceal the money trail to al-qaida .     \u201cthe saudis were so duplicitous , \u201d kreindler said . \u201cthey claim to be allies fighting with u.s. against iran , while at the same time working with the terrorists . there \u2019 s no question they had a hand in the 9/11 attacks. \u201d     presidents george w. bush and barack obama had resisted efforts to hold saudi arabia accountable . the kingdom is a key ally against iran , and its oil interests are important to the united states .     last september , congress overrode an obama veto to pass jasta \u2014 justice against sponsors of terrorism act \u2014 that would allow americans to take legal action against countries that support terrorism .     kreindler wouldn \u2019 t put a dollar figure on the amount of damages being sought by the 800 families of those who died and 1,500 first responders and others who suffered because of the attacks .     \" this lawsuit is a demonstration of the unwavering commitment of the 9/11 families to hold saudi arabia accountable for its critical role in the 9/11 attacks , \" kreindler said .

        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~> in april , as republicans were throwing their weight behind mitt romney and the lengthy , combative presidential primary process was drawing to a close , cnn \u2019 s senior vice president and washington bureau chief sam feist presented his staff with a \u201ccnn half-time election report. \u201d     the four-minute video , shown at the quarterly staff meeting , was a highlight reel of cnn debates , primary night coverage , and interviews interspersed with laudatory reviews . cnn , the video reminded its staff , had hosted more debates than any other network and landed some of the most significant interviews in the election cycle .     text size -     +     reset     \u201cand it \u2019 s only halftime \u2026 \u201d the video concluded .     in fact , the scoreboard , according to many inside and outside the network , doesn \u2019 t look nearly as good as the video suggests .     cnn , the founder of the cable news genre , is now registering its lowest ratings since the first gulf war . in the second quarter of 2012 , the network attracted fewer viewers than at any time in the past 21 years , it was reported tuesday . an average of 446,000 people now watch cnn \u2019 s primetime programming while a mere 319,000 watch its daytime programming \u2014 declines from 2011 that are at least twice as severe as those suffered at fox news and msnbc .     ( also on politico : contempt battle explodes on cnn )     primetime programming is described by media insiders and academics as lackluster and stale . several staffers at the network complain of low morale and an absence of editorial leadership . earlier this month \u2014 in a further sign that all is not well \u2014 the network announced that it intended to cancel poorly rated politics show \u201cjohn king usa. \u201d     one former executive said cnn faces an \u201cidentity crisis. \u201d     while cnn struggles to make 24-hour news compelling , its competitors at fox news and msnbc have redefined the industry . they eschewed traditional , straight-forward newsgathering in favor of partisan , personality driven analysis \u2014 a model that is increasingly successful in an era of hyperpartisan politics , but one that cnn has resisted even as its ratings continue their slow and steady decline .     there is now , according to industry experts , a very real possibility that without a coherent strategy , the only nonpartisan network left on cable could become largely irrelevant to the national conversation .     \u201cnews has become much more personality driven and much more opinionated since cnn launched 32 years ago , and cnn has had difficulty moving in that direction , \u201d brad adgate , senior vice president of research at horizon media , told politico . \u201cthey move in fits and starts , and they don \u2019 t do a very good job of it. \u201d \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>the news for cnn has been bad for a long time , but it got especially bad in the second quarter of this year . ratings for the network\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s prime-time shows plunged by 40 percent from a year ago , and the network\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s performance was its worst ever for a second quarter .     cnn ties this to bad news \u00e2\u20ac \u201d or no news really \u00e2\u20ac \u201d because a year ago several breaking events during the quarter enhanced the network\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s ratings , while this year the three-month period was relatively quiet .     and all three cable news networks experienced declines in the second quarter among the viewers who matter to news advertisers , those from the ages of 25 to 54.\u00e2 msnbc was down by 18 percent and fox news down by 14 percent , while cnn\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s decline was more than double those figures .     after its worst-ever may , and now a worst-ever quarter , the litany of \u201cworst evers \u201d is growing at cnn , which has yet to find an answer to what to do when news is light . the network still steers clear of the opinion-oriented programs that bring regular streams of viewers to hosts like bill o\u00e2\u20ac \u2122reilly and sean hannity on fox and rachel maddow on msnbc .     another worst ever for cnn was the rating from the piers morgan show at 9 p.m , which was down 32 percent from a year ago , to just 137,000 viewers in the 25-54 group . cnn has never before had a 9 p.m. show do that badly for a quarter .     the figures for those 25-54 year-old viewers went like this :     for its monday through friday prime time , cnn averaged 142,000 viewers , down from 236,000 a year ago . msnbc averaged 227,000 , down from 278,000 in 2011. fox news , while posting its worst quarter in that ad-preferred group since the second quarter of 2008 , still led easily with 438,000 , down from 508,000 a year ago .     in terms of total viewers , the fox advantage , as always , was much greater . it averaged 2.14 million viewers , about flat with last

) and purposely causing \u201cgreat division &amp; distrust. \u201d early in his presidency , trump said , \u201ci \u2019 ve never seen more dishonest media than , frankly , the political media. \u201d     most journalists agree that there \u2019 s a great need for trump rebuttals . i \u2019 ve written my share . but this globe-sponsored coordinated editorial response is sure to backfire : it will provide trump with circumstantial evidence of the existence of a national press cabal that has been convened solely to oppose him . when the editorials roll off the press on thursday , all singing from the same script , trump will reap enough fresh material to whale on the media for at least a month . his forthcoming speeches almost write themselves : by colluding against me , the fake media proved once and for all , that they are in cahoots with the democrats and have declared themselves to be my true political opposition \u2026     the globe \u2019 s anti-trump project is also an exercise in redundancy , not to mention self-stroking . most newspapers have already published a multitude of editorials and columns rebuking the president for his trash-talking of the press . most major editorial boards opposed trump \u2019 s election , according to this tally by business insider . the largest of the 19 newspapers to endorse trump was the las vegas review-journal , owned by one of his faithful donors , sheldon adelson . more than 240 endorsed hillary clinton . editorial-page sentiment against trump remains largely unchanged since the election , making the call for a collective reprimand all the more pointless .     another problem with a nationally coordinated pro-press catechism is that the audience likely to reap the greatest benefit from the haranguing \u2014 trump and many in his base \u2014 tends not to read newspapers in the first place . while there \u2019 s always value in preaching to the choir \u2014 that \u2019 s why churches hold services every sunday \u2014 the combined weight of 200 pro-press editorials is not likely to move the opinion needle or deter trump from defaming and threatening reporters .     most newspaper editorials are already a watered-down product of groupthink . it \u2019 s unlikely that expanding the size of the group and encouraging everybody to bake and serve a tuna-fish casserole on the same day will produce editorials that are more interesting and persuasive than the normal fare .     but maybe i \u2019 m wrong . if a single day of pro-press editorials is a good idea for a collective assignment , then maybe newspapers should set aside next saturday for 200 editorials on tariffs and next sunday for 200 editorials on global warming and next monday for 200 editorials on afghanistan . surely these issues are as compelling and urgent as press freedom .     for all its faults , the american press refuses the commands from critics who would have it operate like some monolithic entity . almost daily , our best newspapers express their independence by rejecting the marching orders issued by corporations , politicians and governments . editorial pages of america , don \u2019 t unite !

' many more ' missiles     the un security council met behind closed doors last tuesday to discuss tightening sanctions on north korea after its may 14 launch .     us ambassador nikki haley said the

seoul/washington ( reuters ) - north korea said on monday it successfully tested what it called an intermediate-range ballistic missile , which met all technical requirements and could now be mass-produced , although u.s. officials and experts questioned the extent of its progress .     the united states , which has condemned repeated north korean missile launches , said sunday \u2019 s launch of what north korea dubbed the pukguksong-2 was of a \u201cmedium-range \u201d missile , and u.s.-based experts doubted the reliability of the relatively new solid-fuel type after so few tests .     u.s. officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the test did not demonstrate a new capability , or one that could threaten the united states directly . but the test was north korea \u2019 s second in a week and south korea \u2019 s new liberal government said it dashed its hopes for peace .     u.s. officials have been far less sanguine about the test of a long-range kn-17 , or hwasong-12 , missile just over a week ago , which u.s. officials believe survived re-entry to some degree .     north korea said that launch tested the capability to carry a \u201clarge-size heavy nuclear warhead \u201d and put the u.s. mainland within \u201csighting range. \u201d     western experts say the hwasong-12 test did appear to have advanced north korea \u2019 s aim of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the u.s. mainland , even if it is still some way off from achieving that capability .     the u.n. security council is due to meet on tuesday behind closed doors to discuss sunday \u2019 s test , which defies security council resolutions and sanctions . the meeting was called at the request of the united states , japan and south korea .     washington has been trying to persuade china to agree to new sanctions on north korea , which has conducted dozens of missile firings and tested two nuclear bombs since the start of last year .     u.s. president donald trump has warned that a \u201cmajor , major conflict \u201d with north korea is possible over its weapons programs , although u.s. officials say tougher sanctions , not military force , are the preferred option .     north korea \u2019 s state news agency , kcna , said the latest missile test was supervised by leader kim jong un and verified the reliability of pukguksong-2 \u2019 s solid-fuel engine , stage separation and late-stage guidance for a nuclear warhead . it said data was recorded by a device mounted on the warhead .     \u2018pride \u2019     \u201csaying with pride that the missile \u2019 s rate of hits is very accurate and pukguksong-2 is a successful strategic weapon , he ( kim ) approved the deployment of this weapon system for action , \u201d kcna said .     \u201cnow that its tactical and technical data met the requirements of the party , this type of missile should be rapidly mass-produced in a serial way ... , he said. \u201d     kcna said kim was able to view the earth from a camera mounted on the missile . \u201csupreme leader kim jong un said it feels grand to look at the earth from the rocket we launched and the entire world looks so beautiful , \u201d kcna said .     south korea \u2019 s military said the missile flew about 500 km ( 310 miles ) , reaching an altitude of 560 km ( 350 miles ) .     it said the test would have provided more \u201cmeaningful data \u201d for north korea \u2019 s missile program , but further analysis was necessary to determine whether pyongyang had mastered the technology needed to stop the warhead burning up on re-entering the earth \u2019 s atmosphere .     u.s.-based experts said the pukguksong-2 would have a maximum range of about 1,500 km ( 930 miles ) and questioned north korea \u2019 s assertion that the reliability of the solid-fuel missile had been proven , given limited testing .     \u201centering mass production this early in the development phase is risky , but perhaps a risk north korea feels comfortable managing , \u201d said michael elleman of the international institute for strategic studies .     jeffrey lewis , of the california-based middlebury institute of international studies , said north korea would probably continue to test the missile after deployment , fixing flaws as they emerged .     the use of solid fuel presents advantages for weapons because it is more stable and can be transported easily allowing for a launch at very short notice from mobile launchers .     developing longer-range solid fuel missiles , however , was highly complicated and would \u201ctake time , lots of it , \u201d elleman said .     john schilling , a missile expert contributing to washington \u2019 s 38 north think tank , estimated it would take until at least 2020 for north korea to be able to develop an icbm capable of reaching the u.s. mainland and until 2025 for one powered by solid fuel .     north korea \u2019 s current missiles already pose a threat to south korea and japan and the tens of thousands of u.s. troops based in both countries .     daniel russel , washington \u2019 s former top diplomat for asia , said pyongyang

( associated press )     tokyo ( ap ) \u2014 north korea says it ' s ready to deploy and start mass-producing a new medium-range missile capable of reaching japan and major u.s. military bases there following a test launch it claims confirmed the missile ' s combat readiness and is an \" answer \" to president donald trump ' s policies .     the solid-fuel pukguksong-2 missile flew about 500 kilometers ( 310 miles ) and reached a height of 560 kilometers ( 350 miles ) sunday before plunging into the pacific ocean . north korea ' s media said more missiles will be launched in the future .     trump , traveling in saudi arabia , had no immediate public comment .     north korean leader kim jong un ordered the launch and watched from an observation post , state media reported monday . the korea central news agency said the test verified technical aspects of the weapon system and examined its \" adaptability under various battle conditions \" before it is deployed to military units .     kim reportedly said the launch was a success , \" approved the deployment of this weapon system for action \" and said that it should \" be rapidly mass-produced . \"     north korea has significantly speeded up its missile tests over the past year or so and appears to be making tangible progress toward developing an arsenal that poses a threat not only to south korea and japan \u2014 which together host about 80,000 u.s. troops \u2014 but also toward an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland united states .     it ' s moving ahead with its nuclear weapons program as well .     the north conducted two nuclear tests last year . it claims one was a hydrogen bomb and the other device created a more powerful explosion than any the north has previous tested . satellite imagery suggests it could be ready to conduct its next test \u2014 which would be its sixth \u2014 at virtually any time .     pyongyang ' s often-stated goal is to perfect a nuclear warhead that it can put on a missile capable of hitting washington or other u.s. cities .     north korea ' s media , meanwhile , have stepped up their calls for even more missile launches because of what pyongyang claims is an increasingly hostile policy by president donald trump .     \" the trump administration would be well advised to lend an ear to the voices of concern that are heard from the u.s. and the international community , \" the north ' s minju joson newspaper said in a commentary sunday . \" many more ' juche weapons ' capable of striking the u.s. will be launched from this land . this is the dprk ' s answer to the trump administration. ' \"     \" juche , \" in this usage , refers to domestically produced and dprk is short for the north ' s official name , the democratic people ' s republic of korea .     in an interview with \" fox news sunday \" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said the ongoing testing is \" disappointing \" and \" disturbing . \"     south korea held a national security council meeting after the launch , and its foreign ministry said the launch \" throws cold water \" on efforts to ease tensions on the peninsula .     at the request of diplomats from the u.s. , japan and south korea , a united nations ' security council consultation on the missile test will take place tuesday .     north korea a week earlier had successfully tested a new midrange missile \u2014 the hwasong 12 \u2014 that it said could carry a heavy nuclear warhead .     experts said that rocket flew higher and for a longer time than any other missile previously tested by north korea and represents another big advance toward a viable icbm .     david wright , an expert on north korea ' s missiles and nuclear program who is with the union of concerned scientists , said the latest missile could have flown farther but was fired on a \" lofted \" trajectory , which sends the missile high up so that it will land in the open seas rather than flying over or splashing down near neighboring countries .     he noted the pukguksong-2 ' s solid fuel is of particular concern .     solid-fuel missiles have their fuel loaded in them before being moved into place , allowing them to be launched faster and with more secrecy . liquid-fuel missiles , on the other hand , are fueled at the launch site in a process that can last an hour and requires fueling and other vehicles . that makes then easier to spot and easier to destroy than the solid-fuel variety .     ___     ap writers kim tong-hyung in seoul and edith m. lederer in new york contributed to this report . talmadge is the ap ' s pyongyang bureau chief . follow him on twitter at twitter.com/erictalmadge and instagram at erictalmadge . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",

how old is he ? what drove him to such extremism ?     answers to those questions are unclear . but the militant now has an identity . as per the british press , the masked man is known as \u201cjihadi john. \u201d the nickname speaks to claims slowly trickling out about the killer .     john \u2019 s accent , which experts contend signifies london origins , is the source of his alias , the bbc reported in a radio broadcast on thursday . john is believed to lead a small cadre of three british militants who guard the islamic state \u2019 s foreign hostages . because of their captors \u2019 accents , hostages called them \u201cjohn , paul and ringo after the beatles , \u201d the bbc \u2019 s frank gardner reported on thursday .     it \u2019 s not surprising that foley \u2019 s executioner was a foreigner \u2014 specifically , a briton . militants from britain account for a larger proportion of the islamic state \u2019 s forces than nearly every other western country . estimates place their number anywhere from 800 to 1,500. today , more british muslims may fight for the islamic state than for britain \u2019 s own military , according to usa today and the times of london , underscoring the militants \u2019 presence in the united kingdom . recruiters recently passed out islamic state propaganda in london advocating enlistment , and supporters flew a black jihadist flag there earlier this month .     such fighters are more radicalized than other members of the islamic state . \u201cforeign fighters are often used for the most brutal acts because they are the most ideologically motivated , \u201d peter neumann , director of the international center for the study of radicalization , told the washington post \u2019 s griff witte . \u201cthe locals may say , \u2018that \u2019 s not the kind of thing we do here. \u2019 but the outsiders don \u2019 t know that. \u201d     of particular brutality was james foley \u2019 s executioner . john is an \u201cintelligent , educated and a devout believer in radical islamic teachings , \u201d according to the guardian , which interviewed a hostage who was also held captive by him . he is reported to have led negotiations with at least eight western families in the past year for the release of their loved ones , and may have been involved last spring when islamic state militants released two spanish journalists .     but the islamic state \u2019 s correspondence with foley \u2019 s family was different . the group demanded the astronomical sum of $ 132 million for his release , a \u201cnumber so absurdly high that private third parties or insurance groups that cover kidnappings would have struggled to pay it , \u201d wrote the post \u2019 s adam taylor . it was so high , in fact , that most experts agree the islamic state never expected to get paid . foley , it seemed , would be reserved for something else .     john and the rest of the guards disliked foley . they seized his laptop , and their subsequent discovery that foley \u2019 s brother served in the u.s. air force stirred acts of recrimination , fellow hostage didier francois told europe 1 radio . \u201cbeing an american , he was probably more targeted by the kidnappers , \u201d another captured french journalist told the bbc . \u201cwell , he would be beaten a bit more probably , he was some kind of scapegoat . and the kidnappers knew that his brother was in the u.s. air force . he became the whipping-boy of the jailers. \u201d     one particularly brutal scene came right before francois \u2019 s release in april of this year . the jihadists began to perform mock executions on foley . \u201cone of the last times i saw him before leaving , the group \u2014 which has macabre taste \u2014 had forced him to pose as if he was being crucified against a wall , \u201d fran\u00e7ois said , according to the wall street journal ..     finally , on aug. 12 , days before foley \u2019 s execution , his captors sent a final e-mail to foley \u2019 s family . the publication foley wrote for , globalpost , published the letter in full with the permission of folely \u2019 s family .     \u201chow long will the sheep follow the blind sheppard ? \u201d it read . \u201c \u2026 as for the scum of your society who are held by us , they dared to enter the lion \u2019 s den and where eaten ! \u2026 today our swords are unsheathed towards you , government and citizens alike ! and we will not stop untill we quench our thirst for your blood . \u2026 you and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings ! the first of which being the blood of the american citizen , james foley ! he will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions toward us ! \u201d \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> up to 20 western hostages are being held by the jihadi group that beheaded james foley .     as well as the journalist steven sotloff , who was threatened with beheading by the same man who murdered foley , islamic state in iraq and the levant ( isil ) is holding a number of aid workers , thought to include vanessa marzullo , 21 , and greta ramelli , 20 , both italian .     three aid workers employed by the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) are also being held hostage after they were abducted last october .     as fears grew that isil could make good on its threat to murder more hostages , families of those being held defended their loved ones \u2019 decisions to travel to syria .     ms ramelli \u2019 s mother , antonella , said her daughter had been determined from an early age to look after others , starting by helping out in a retirement home when she was 12.     responding to suggestions that she should not have allowed her daughter to travel to syria , mrs ramelli said : \u201cwhen you hear your daughter say ' mamma , in that country they are killing children , i must go and help , \u2019 what can you say ? \u201d     \u201ccan you go back on all the teaching and the values you have tried to instill for a lifetime ? \u201d she told prealpina , an italian newspaper . \u201ccan you change your daughter , who has these values and has strong ideals about solidarity and human empathy ? \u201d     the two women went missing near aleppo in syria at the beginning of this month . on thursday the italian foreign office declined to comment on whether they were now in the hands of isil .     the red cross has not released details of the nationality , gender or age of their aid workers currently being held hostage . the three were among a group of seven who were kidnapped , four of whom were released shortly afterwards .     a spokesman for the charity said : \u201cintensive efforts are ongoing behind the scenes to secure the release of the remaining three colleagues , through the icrc \u2019 s broad network on the ground .     \" we cannot provide details about this for the sake of the ongoing safety of our colleagues still abducted. \u201d     former hostages who had been held with foley described how he had been singled out for beatings because he was an american .     didier francois , a 53-year-old reporter with the french radio station europe 1 , said mr foley was tortured after his captors found pictures on his computer of his brother , who works for the us air force .     foley was subjected to mock executions , including one in which he was \u201ccrucified against a wall \u201d .     paying tribute to the american , mr francois said : \u201che was an extraordinary guy \u2014 a companion in imprisonment who was very agreeable , very solid. \u201d     mr francois spent eight months held hostage in syria with foley , mostly in underground cells with no natural light .     for two-and-a-half months , mr francois was chained to fellow french hostages nicolas henin , edouard elias , and pierre torres . mr francois said he had never spoken publicly about mr foley or mr sotloff before because of threats of reprisals .     mr henin also paid tribute to mr foley , saying : \u201cjames was a very good friend and a great support . he was always there when you were feeling not so well with some kind words . he managed to make seven months of captivity easier. \u201d     mr henin , however , was sceptical about reports that a group of british jihadists nicknamed \u201cthe beatles \u201d were the prime culprits . \u201cif investigators were to go in that direction , they would be misleading themselves , \u201d he said .     jeroen oerlemans , a dutch journalist who was held hostage in syria with a british colleague , john cantlie , for nine days last year before the two men were freed , said foley had worked tirelessly trying to secure their release .     he said : \u201cthe colleague with whom i was abducted was good friends with james . when we missed our appointment with him , somewhere in syria , alarm bells immediately went off for foley . he pulled back across the border to turkey , and put all his journalistic contacts gathering information on us. \u201d     when the two men were freed by opposition forces , he said : \u201cjames was the first to hug me . i did not know him , but because he had been so closely involved with our liberation he knew me well. \u201d     mr oerlemans decided syria was too dangerous to return to , saying : \u201cyou must know very well who you go into business with , your contacts must be one hundred per cent reliable . and even then , james was hugely experienced and had those contacts . yet it happened to him. \u201d \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> the seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the wayback machine     this crawl was run at a level 1 ( urls including their embeds , plus the urls of all outbound links including their embeds )     the warc files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",

pear . waist larger that the hips ? apple . no curves ? banana .     but now there \u2019 s a new choice : dove says women can also be soap bottles .     the unilever brand that \u2019 s been on a mission to get women to embrace their \u201creal beauty \u201d for a few years \u2014 while other unilever brands teach other women to change the color of their own skin \u2014 has launched a new campaign to empower women to embrace their body shape .     in the uk , the company will sell a limited edition of six real beauty bottles : unusually curvy shampoo bottles that look like they were inspired by a mix of illegal drugs and constantin brancusi .     \u201cwe \u2019 ve created a limited edition range of dove body washes , designed to show how beauty is diverse and diversity is beautiful , \u201d said unilever in a press release , explaining how these are intended to depict real women \u2019 s bodies . all body wash bottles \u2014 i mean , women \u2014 are beautiful as they are .     many women do not seem pleased . not only are they not running to the drugstore , they are making fun of the bottles .     this is the apotheosis of dove \u2019 s misguided brand of \u201cempowering advertising , \u201d which tends to end up exploiting the very female insecurities that it claims to destroy . well-intentioned or not , the message behind all of these campaigns is the same we \u2019 ve always heard : be beautiful .     of course , dove is selling soap , not programming classes , so it makes sense \u2014 but the attempt to mask that mandate as stereotype-busting is ineffective at best . it \u2019 s just not that empowering to overhaul the ideals of feminine beauty : we \u2019 re never going to find all people and bodies equally beautiful , no matter how many commercials feature women getting teary-eyed after embracing their own outer beauty . some women will always be more beautiful than others , just like men are . the only way to actually help women escape the \u201cbeauty trap \u201d is to simply make beauty less important \u2014 just like it is for men . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> of course this is how it ends .     dove , friendly soap company and bastion of body-positive marketing , finally goes too far and literally engineers its packing to reflect the women to whom it markets .     according to dove :     \" each bottle evokes the shapes , sizes , curves and edges that combine to make every woman their very own limited edition . they \u2019 re one of a kind \u2013 just like you . but sometimes we all need reminding of that .     recent research from the dove global beauty and confidence report revealed that one in two women feels social media puts pressure on them to look a certain way . thankfully , many women are fighting with us to spread beauty confidence . \"     and apparently the best way to make sure women are reminded daily of our special snowflakeness is to turn our soap bottles into literal reminders of our figures . because bathing isn ' t just a time to get clean and enjoy a hot shower and some peace , but also to be , you know , empowered . by our soap bottles .     we ' ve reached out to dove to ask a few of our most burning questions , including :     will the bottles all contain the same amount of soap ?     do the body-positive cost bottles cost the same as normal ones , or will we pay a premium for our empowerment ?     how long will we be able to purchase these limited-edition keepsakes ?     where in the world did this idea come from ?

the one she wishes she did? \u2014 to a cashier to handle and perhaps to judge . what otherwise would have been a body-image-free trip to the store becomes a trip that highlights body-image .     now imagine actually using the bottles . in the shower , they become slippery . the pear shapes are unwieldy , all their weight pressed to the sides . that will make them hard to hold in a single-hand . the tall , thin bottles are gangly . they fall over easily when bumped on the shelf .     ah , but which bottle is least cumbersome ? the hourglass-shaped bottles , of course . the ones with big \u201cbosoms \u201d and \u201chips , \u201d providing firm grip around the \u201cwaist \u201d when wet . and just like that , against the campaign \u2019 s hopes , dove engineered bottles that , through functional differences , inadvertently imply there is a best body after all .     * * *     capitalism doesn \u2019 t care about you . but usually it takes some work to uncover that truth . dove is owned by the conglomerate unilever , which also owns axe . axe makes the same kind of products dove does , but markets them to young men , often in overtly sexist ways . that \u2019 s a hypocrisy that reveals advertising \u2019 s true scruples , which involve extracting incremental value from your wallet as efficiently as possible . but at least hiding the hypocrisy in the common ownership of a parent company also obscures it from the consumer \u2019 s view . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",

, the stunned city of kerch prepared to say farewell to the victims .     thousands of residents were expected to attend the funerals of most of the victims friday . the burials are taking place in mainland russia , which annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014.     little information has emerged about the 18-year-old gunman , vladislav roslyakov . authorities said they were investigating if he had an accomplice in wednesday ' s shotgun massacre at kerch polytechnic college .     teachers and classmates have described him as a shy person with few friends . a computer taken from the home where

were exporting bad practices into russia .     speaking at an international policy conference , putin compared roslyakov ' s assault to the numerous school shootings in the united states . in the past few years , authorities have said several school attacks in russia allegedly were inspired by gun violence in the u.s.     putin said that in his view , teenagers getting guns and going on shooting rampages meant adults had failed to offer them alternatives to violence .     \" young people with a fragile mental state are creating false heroes for themselves , \" he said . \" that means that all of us , not only in russia , but in the world on the whole , are reacting poorly to the fast-changing realities . \"     russia has fairly strict gun legislation . civilians can own only hunting rifles and smoothbore shotguns and must undergo significant background checks . roslyakov had only recently received a permit to own a shotgun and had bought 150 cartridges just a few days ago , according to local officials .     asked about possible plans to further restrict gun ownership in russia , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the government would wait for the results of the kerch investigation .     since russia annexed the crimean peninsula from ukraine , russian authorities repeatedly warned of a terrorism threat from unnamed ukrainian nationalists and ethnic tatars , an indigenous crimean people . but despite acts of public defiance and rallies , both groups haven ' t engaged in any violent activities in crimea .     the death toll in kerch , excluding roslyakov , climbed thursday to 20 after one of the wounded died in a hospital , according to russian news agency tass .     dozens of people remained hospitalized in kerch , and at least 10 with severe injuries were being airlifted to top russian hospitals for surgery , health minister veronika skvortsova said .     most victims died from gunshot wounds , authorities said . many others had wounds from an improvised explosive device that went off packed with shrapnel . skvortsova said some victims had their legs or feet blown off .     \" the kids ' muscles have been ' minced ' with small metal objects , \" skvortsova said . \" in those who have their organs ripped apart , we are finding metal balls in kidneys , intestines , in blood vessels . that is how powerful the blast was . \"     taisiya roslyakova , the grandmother of the young man said to have carried out the attack , told the komsomolskaya pravda daily thursday that her grandson was a kind boy who always helped her with chores , unlike his father .     she said roslyakov did not have many friends and spent all his time indoors playing computer games . she said she last saw him a week ago when he stopped by and asked if he could take all the family photo albums .     ___     vladimir isachenkov and jim heintz in moscow contributed . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> image copyright afp image caption

washington \u2014 when the news broke that reality winner , a 25-year-old nsa contractor with an apparently heavy social media presence , had been charged with leaking a classified document to reporters , many people wondered : how does someone so young have a such a top-level security clearance ?     it \u2019 s actually very common .     \" the vast majority of people who do the national security agency \u2019 s intercept work , who translate and analyze \u2014 most of them are fresh out of high school , \" said matthew aid , an intelligence historian who has written about the nsa . \" there are thousands and thousands of 18 to 21-year-olds doing critically important and secret work around the world . \"     related : feds arrest nsa contractor in leak of top secret russia document     the nsa is a military intelligence agency , and many of the people who work on the front lines of intelligence gathering in the military are young enlisted personnel . if they are eavesdropping on anyone from a terrorist in afghanistan to a russian colonel , they need a very high security clearance . the equipment , the methods , the words they hear \u2014 are all highly classified .     so it was that winner , who served in the air force from 2010 until december 2016 , found her way to a job as a contractor at an nsa facility in georgia . a cryptologic language analyst for the air force , she was fluent in the languages of afghanistan . she was arrested at her home saturday for allegedly leaking a document about russian hacking of u.s. electoral systems that was published in a story by the intercept on monday afternoon .     the issue that winner \u2019 s arrest highlights is not her age , current and former intelligence officials say \u2014 it is what they perceive as a cultural shift that has led a small but growing subset of spy agency employees to break the ultimate organizational taboo , and share secrets with the public and the news media .     there have always been american spies who have betrayed their country for money . now , from chelsea manning to edward snowden to reality winner , a new class of rogue employee has emerged : people who decide there are secrets the public needs to know , and take it upon themselves to share them with reporters .     reality leigh winner , 25 , a federal contractor charged by the u.s. department of justice for sending classified material to a news organization , poses in a picture posted to her instagram account . reality winner / instagram via reuters     \" it \u2019 s a new kind of insider threat that the agency can \u2019 t defend against , \" aid said .     and it \u2019 s getting worse , he added , in part because \" donald trump and the change in the political scene in america has created an environment for a lot of people who feel that they have to do something . you become an instant activist . \"     winner was vocal in her opposition to trump on social media , but her motives are unclear . according to federal charging documents , she admitted to mailing a top secret document detailing russian hacking intelligence to the news media . she faces one count of \" gathering , transmitting or losing defense information . \"     the lines are blurry , but winner and those like her seem in a different class than the washington insiders who have always leaked to settle internal scores or to make policy points . they are small fries , far from the nation \u2019 s power centers , inside a vast intelligence apparatus who decide the public needs to know what they do . manning leaked from baghdad ; snowden was based in hawaii ; winner was in georgia .     \" these are people who have a greater sense of loyalty to some outside cause than to the organization they are working in , and that \u2019 s a new thing for the intelligence community , \" said a former senior nsa official , who asked not to be named so he could speak more candidly about sensitive topics .     there is another dimension , another former nsa official said : too much information is classified , and everyone working in intelligence knows it .     related : nsa leak mystery not solved with arrest of hal martin     indeed , the document winner allegedly leaked did not seem , on its face , to be terribly sensitive . the u.s. government , after all , was perfectly willing to acknowledge its authenticity by charging winner barely an hour after the story broke on the intercept , as if to send a message . the charging documents don \u2019 t link the case to the intercept , but officials quickly did so in background comments to reporters .     her attorney , titus thomas nichols , said winner has yet to enter a plea , although a detention hearing is scheduled for

a special agent with the fbi .     pluribus international corporation lists one employee location in georgia on its website -- fort gordon , a united states army installation -- but it ' s unclear if that is indeed where winner was based .     abc news reached out to pluribus international corporation for a comment about winner ' s arrest but did not immediately receive a response .     she had top secret security clearance at her job , garrick wrote in the affidavit .     on or about may 9 , 2017 , winner allegedly printed and improperly removed the classified intelligence report , according to garrick ' s affidavit , which noted that the material had been dated on may 5.     the intercept reached out to the government on may 30 for comment on the story it was planning to run , and on june 1 , the fbi was notified about that interaction .     according to the affidavit , winner confessed to agent garrick on june 3.     winner was formally charged by the justice department with removing and mailing classified material to a news outlet on monday . she has not yet entered a plea .     her attorney told abc news that winner remains in federal custody , and will have a

pashto , farsi and dari , according to her attorney , and had recently worked as a yoga instructor at a studio called oh yeah yoga in augusta .     oh yeah yoga owner annalisa adams described winner to abc news as a \" reliable \" employee .     \" she taught first class at my studio in january , \" adams said . \" she started doing sub stuff but eventually - she was so reliable - i gave her two

[ o/r ]     average u.s. retail fuel prices have surged by more than a dime per gallon from a week ago , the aaa said early on thursday .     the gulf makes up nearly half of total refining capacity in the united states , the world ' s largest net exporter of refined petroleum products , and the storm is set to impact global flows . ( graphic : tmsnrt.rs/2xzskwz )     about 4.4 million barrels of u.s. refining capacity have been shut by harvey , including the nation \u2019 s largest refiner , motiva port arthur , which can process more than 600,000 barrels a day . the total shut-in is about 24 percent of u.s. refining capacity , almost equal to japan \u2019 s daily consumption .     the closures rattled global fuel markets , and european and asian traders diverted millions of barrels of gasoline and diesel to the americas to help fill that gap . but the supplies from those distant markets may not arrive fast enough to avert a crunch .     \u201csourcing additional barrels from europe is a potential solution , but an increased level of uncertainty is introduced surrounding the timeliness of delivery , given the logistics of travel time and securing tankers , \u201d said michael tran , director of global energy strategy at rbc capital markets .     the asian refining margin on thursday hit $ 10.41 a barrel , the highest since january 2016 dub-sin-ref . gasoline prices in the region gl92-sin-crk were $ 16.34 a barrel , also the highest since january 2016. in europe , benchmark gasoline margins jumped to a two-year high of nearly $ 21 per barrel .     the u.s. disruptions have hit wholesalers . the premium for chicago-area gasoline above benchmark futures is at its highest since june 2016 , while the gulf coast price is at its widest above futures since august 2012 . [ pro/u ]     suppliers in chicago were trying to secure supplies after the explorer pipeline , which typically carries about 350,000 barrels a day ( bpd ) to the region , shut down .     \u201cit \u2019 s not a significant problem at the present time , but it could turn into one , \u201d said william fleischli , executive vice president of the illinois petroleum marketers association , which

from a day earlier and 10.1 cents from a week ago , aaa data showed .     in georgia and north carolina , fuel prices are up about 17 cents and average prices in south carolina have risen nearly 20 cents per gallon from a week ago .     though flood waters have yet to recede , energy analysts said they anticipated potential long-term effects from the historic storm . goldman sachs analysts wrote

bpd ) port arthur refinery was shut on wednesday due to flooding from tropical storm harvey .     in a statement to cnbc , motiva said it \" cannot provide a timeline for restart at this time . \" the

hurricane harvey .     the energy department said it will send 500,000 barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to the phillips 66 ( psx ) refinery in lake charles , louisiana .     the oil reserve is made up of a complex of tanks and deeper underground storage caverns . it can hold more than 700 million barrels of oil , making it the largest emergency oil reserve in the world .     the move is aimed at shielding americans from higher gasoline prices , which have begun to rise sharply due to a shortage of gasoline caused by refinery shutdowns , port closures and oil production outages .     officials said the refinery , which hasn ' t been shutdown by the historic flooding , requested the release of emergency oil . warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway ( brka ) is the largest shareholder in phillips 66     the energy department said it will \" continue to provide assistance as deemed necessary , \" including more potential drawdowns from the emergency reserve .     the decision to tap the oil reserve follows the shutdown of the colonial pipeline , which normally carries a huge amount of gasoline between houston and the east coast . the key pipeline was knocked offline because there isn ' t enough gasoline flowing for it to operate .     related : harvey shuts down major fuel pipeline     energy secretary rick perry noted the colonial pipeline outage is driven by limited gasoline supplies , not damage to the pipeline itself .     \" i don ' t know how long it ' s going to take to get those ( refineries ) back on , \" perry told reporters on thursday aboard air force two with vice president mike pence .     matt smith , director of commodities research at clipperdata , said the emergency stockpile release is likely aimed at helping to fill up the colonial pipeline .     \" there ' s a huge logistical challenge going on at the moment because those refineries up and running don ' t have access to the oil they need , \" said smith .     the energy department is also trying to ease fears about a severe gasoline shortage .     \" this release sends a message to the market that the u.s. government is willing to address any kind of supply shortages . there ' s definitely a psychological impact , \" said joe mcmonigle , a former energy department official who now serves as senior energy analyst at the hedgeye potomac research group .     the widespread disruption in the u.s. gulf coast has lifted the average price of a gallon of gasoline by 10 cents to $ 2.449 on thursday , according to aaa .     related : harvey to be one of the most expensive natural disasters ever     mcmonigle predicted the energy department will take more steps because refinery recoveries are likely to be slow .     historic flooding caused by harvey knocked one-fifth of the nation ' s refining capacity offline , according to s&p global platts . thirteen oil refineries in texas have shut down or are in the process of closing , while others are operating at reduced rates .     \" the situation on the ground is even worse than what is being reported . this may not be a quick turnaround . it could take some time for the industry to get back on its feet , \" mcmonigle said .     the u.s. dipped into the strategic oil reserve during other disruptions , such as the 2011 turmoil in libya and during hurricane katrina in 2005.     earlier this year , president trump proposed selling off half of the oil sitting in the reserve to raise revenue . some analysts at the time criticized the proposal as risky . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> gasoline prices were surging again thursday amid refinery closings in texas caused by hurricane harvey .     gas futures for september delivery were up 12 % to $ 2.11 a gallon at 10 : 40 a.m. et . in their eighth straight day of gains , futures are on their longest rising streak in four years , according to bloomberg . futures for october delivery also rallied .     prices at the pump are also higher . the aaa average national gas price at 3 : 43 a.m. et on thursday was $ 2.449 a gallon , up from an average price of $ 2.348 a gallon last week .     motiva ' s refinery in port arthur , texas , which is the largest refinery in the us , shut down wednesday as floodwater rose . and on thursday , colonial pipeline , which owns the largest pipeline for gas distribution in the us , had planned to shut down its gasoline line because gulf coast refiners were unable to process crude oil , bloomberg reported . \" deliveries will be intermittent and dependent on terminal and refinery supply , \" the company said in an update .     to help with the gasoline shortage , the energy department on thursday said it was releasing 500,000 barrels of oil from its strategic petroleum reserve that holds supplies for emergencies . the agency said it loaned the barrels of both sweet and sour crude to a phillips 66 refinery in lake charles , louisiana , which has not been affected by hurricane harvey .     the fort worth star-telegram reported that some gas stations in the area may run out of supplies during the labor day weekend . gas stations on the east coast could also experience shortages , bloomberg reported , and this could send gas prices even higher .     crude-oil prices rose in a \" knee jerk reaction \" tracking gasoline following news that exxon mobil was shutting down its beaumont , texas , refinery for up to two weeks , according to jesse cohen of investing.com . the closing of the motiva refinery and news that the storm irma had strengthened to a hurricane and could hit gulf production provided another boost , cohen said .     the front-month west texas intermediate crude-oil contract gained 2.5 % to $ 47.09 a barrel but remained on track for its fifth straight weekly decline .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> update :     colonial pipeline said it expects to be able to return to full service sunday , restoring a critical fuel pipeline that serves much of the southeast .     colonial ' s lines 1 and 2 continue to operate from lake charles , louisiana to the east , the company said , but deliveries will be intermittent and dependent on terminal and refinery supplies . lines remain down from houston - one of the areas hardest hit by the storm to herbert , texas .     \" we currently estimate that we will be able to return to service from houston sunday , following an evaluation of our infrastructure and successful execution of our start up plan , \" colonial said .     colonial pipeline 1 carries as much as 40 percent of the south ' s gasoline . line 2 primarily transports diesel and aviation fuels .     earlier :     colonial pipeline has shut down key fuel lines running from houston through mississippi , georgia alabama and up the east coast after hurricane harvey forced the closure of refineries and other facilities .     colonial said its facilities west of lake charles , louisiana are out of service due to the storms . that closure , along with hurricane-related shutdowns of refineries in the gulf coast , led to the decision to cease operations on colonial ' s line 2 , which transports primarily diesel and aviation fuels . line 1 , which carries gasoline , will suspend service today . line 1 had been operating at a reduced capacity since harvey hit .     line 1 provides nearly 40 percent of the south ' s gasoline .     \" once colonial is able to ensure that its facilities are safe to operate and refiners in lake charles and points east have the ability to move product to colonial , our system will resume operations , \" the company said in a statement .     by volume , colonial is the largest pipeline operator in the country , delivering more than 100 million gallons of refined products each day to markets between houston and new york city , serving more than 50 million people . of the 26 refineries connected to the colonial system , 13 are located between houston and lake charles , the company said .     the shutdowns are adding to growing concerns about fuel availability as drivers around the southeast find themselves paying more at the pump . on thursday morning , the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the u.s. was $ 2.462 , up almost 2 cents from yesterday and 11 cents from last week , according to fuel tracking site gasbuddy .     experts said prices could increase as much as 35 cents a gallon as refineries remain offline during storm cleanup .     in its statement , colonial addressed those concerns .     \" colonial is one part of the fuel delivery system , and there are multiple means of supplying the market to mitigate concerns with supply , including other pipelines , trucks , and barges , \" it said .     georgia-based colonial was twice forced to shut down parts of its pipeline last year due to a leak and a fire in alabama . the shutdowns led to higher gas prices and isolated shortages across the southeast .     hurricane harvey made its first landfall in texas last friday , dumping more than 50 inches of rain on houston and surrounding counties . the storm made a second landfall wednesday in louisiana and is now tracking to the northeast through mississippi and northern alabama . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given

( the other day , a friend texted me : \u201ck. \u201d i knew what she meant. ) to send a text is to say , \u201ci \u2019 m sending you this message with my thumbs . that \u2019 s all you get of me. \u201d \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> what a difference four years makes : when she was running for the democratic presidential nomination , hillary clinton was parodied as drab and calculated , especially compared with young and vigorous barack obama and winking and fresh-faced sarah palin . now , she \u2019 s fueling internet jokes based on her own brand of badass cool .     more than just an image rebound , clinton is enjoying a genuine resurgence .     her 2008 campaign , which once seemed a cautionary tale about hubris , looks at least somewhat better with age . obama touted a unifying national message in his run against clinton , suggesting that clinton \u2019 s scars from decades of battling republicans would make it difficult to ever be effective in the white house .     now obama \u2019 s post-partisan vision has given way to a tough dogfight of a general election in which he \u2019 s running against the intransigent republican party \u2019 s \u201cthinly veiled social darwinism. \u201d and clinton \u2019 s popularity \u2014 including with republicans \u2014 has never been higher , prompting yet another boomlet of interest in a 2016 presidential run .     part of this is the nature of her position . the secretary of state has traditionally been an apolitical figure and , consequently , those who have held the position have often enjoyed higher approval ratings than their boss . clinton has held fast to this tradition and avoided injecting herself into the day \u2019 s hot-button issues . there are some occasional exceptions \u2014 last month she told msnbc \u2019 s andrea mitchell that she was glad to see rush limbaugh \u2019 s screed against law student sandra fluke draw widespread condemnation .     still , given how well established \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 a political figure clinton was considered prior to her appointment compared to many of her predecessors , the scale of her popularity is impressive . a recent gallup poll showed her favorability rating reach new heights at 66 percent , including 40 percent of republicans who view her positively , an astronomical figure for a prominent democrat these days . from the public \u2019 s perspective , it \u2019 s clear that she \u2019 s settled easily into a behind-the-scenes role as a loyal and competent secretary of state .     her lower visibility seems to have created some pent-up demand from her fans , though . this week a website \u201ctexts from hillary \u201d created by two supporters , stacy lambe and adam smith , exploded on the internet , generating tens of thousands of links on facebook and tumblr in its first 24 hours . the site features several two-panel gags that show clinton on her blackberry , clad in shades on a military jet , purportedly texting with various political and pop culture figures , from condoleezza rice to ryan gosling .     clinton \u2019 s cold , relentless style was considered one of her biggest vulnerabilities , forming the basis for parodies of her on \u201csaturday night live \u201d and attracting a number of sexist jabs from pundits . by the end of her campaign , however , she had drawn considerable respect even from many critics for her toughness and resolve during a long and difficult primary . lambe told tpm he was hoping to capture this trait in his site .     \u201cthat photo just captures how people tried to make her out to be a bitch when she \u2019 s actually the head bitch in charge , \u201d lambe said . \u201cever since she was appointed secretary of state there \u2019 s been a renewed appreciation for hillary. \u201d     as for the idea for the initial two-panel gag , \u201cthe alcohol helped , \u201d said smith .     it \u2019 s no accident that the notion of clinton as the peak of steady competence has proven so resonant . phil singer , a spokesman for her 2008 presidential campaign , told tpm clinton \u2019 s recent success follows a consistent trend in which she is best regarded when working on policy instead of politics . before her 2008 run , for example , clinton was an extremely popular senator both in new york and among her colleagues .     \u201cwhen people see her doing her job and not getting involved with the back-and-forth , they \u2019 re happy , \u201d singer said , acknowledging that it was \u201cironic \u201d given her highly political roles as first lady , a tough senate candidate in 2000 and an even tougher presidential candidate in 2008.     the fact that she \u2019 s kept her hands clean during an incredibly tense three-year standoff between the white house and national republicans may also artificially boost her standing as voters imagine what could have been if she had won the nomination .     \u201csome people \u2019 s views on her may be reflective of the fact people had higher hopes for obama , \u201d republican strategist liz mair said , \u201cand its sort of evened out so she looks better by comparison. \u201d     not surprisingly , the 2016 speculation that began even before the 2008 election ended is worming its way back into the press in a major way . plenty of democrats are hoping she \u2019 ll run again , with nancy pelosi declaring just last week that she should consider waging another bid .     clinton has mostly avoided the topic , though she \u2019 s hinted that her political days may be behind her at this point . she would be 69 on inauguration day , 2017.     \u201ci believe that she \u2019 s being absolutely honest with you when she says she doesn \u2019 t think she \u2019 ll go back into politics , \u201d bill clinton told abc news recently . \u201cbut if she comes home and we do this foundation stuff for the rest of our lives , i \u2019 ll be happy ; if she changes her mind and decides to run , i \u2019 ll be happy. \u201d     were clinton to run she would almost certainly shed a significant amount of her current popularity with the right as soon as she seized a partisan mantle again . but her impressive tenure as secretary of state in a difficult transition period from the tumultuous bush era would only boost her core appeal as the party \u2019 s most battle-tested heavyweight . one need only look to the equivalent time period in the 2004 presidential cycle to underscore how unpredictable things are in politics \u2014 barack obama was a virtually unknown state senator then , and george allen was widely considered the man to beat on the republican side .     benjy sarlin benjy sarlin is a reporter for talking points memo and co-writes the campaign blog , tpm2012 . he previously reported for the daily beast/newsweek as their washington correspondent and covered local politics for the new york sun .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> it \u2019 s been an overwhelming \u2013 and hilarious \u2013 week for us here at texts from hillary ( tfh ) . what started as a joke at the bar

end up being constrained . but , i just , if you could , i \u2019 m not asking any different than i have the entire 10 years and eight months that i have been in office . you know , and one of the reasons , the main reason was the statement that i made . you know , i told people , i didn \u2019 t intend to serve more than two terms , that \u2019 s been a really big drag on me .     but in

m here , i can hear you . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> republicans woke up columbus day morning to the sights and sounds of the wheels coming off their midterm-election bus and their legislative jalopy . first came a widely publicized war of words between president trump and the prominent republican senator , foreign relations committee chairman bob corker . then came a bloomberg news story by jennifer jacobs and bill allison laying out steve bannon \u2019 s intention to back challengers to most of the gop senators seeking re-election next year .     the trump-corker contretemps began last week when the tennessee lawmaker , who had been a top contender to be trump \u2019 s running mate as well as secretary of state , took an obvious shot at the president when he told reporters that secretary of state rex tillerson , secretary of defense jim mattis , and white house chief of staff john f. kelly \u201care those people that help separate our country from chaos. \u201d corker amplified his criticism on fox news sunday , charging that trump was treating his office like \u201ca reality show , \u201d with reckless threats toward other countries that could set the nation \u201con the path to world war iii. \u201d     the tweet wars then began in earnest . trump fired back that corker \u201cdidn \u2019 t have the guts \u201d to run for re-election , and corker reponded by saying , \u201cit \u2019 s a shame the white house has become an adult day care center . someone obviously missed their shift this morning. \u201d after adding that the former reality television star was \u201clike he \u2019 s doing \u2018the apprentice \u2019 or something , \u201d corker concluded that \u201che concerns me , \u201d and it should \u201cconcern anyone who cares about our nation. \u201d     in a new york times interview later sunday , this in a phone call with jonathan martin and mark landler , corker said that \u201ci know for a fact that every single day at the white house , it \u2019 s a situation of trying to contain him. \u201d trump fired up his twitter gatling gun and wrote that \u201cbob corker gave us the iran deal , &amp; that \u2019 s about it . we need healthcare , we need tax cuts/reform , we need people that can get the job done ! \u201d     while trump has been highly critical of the republican-led congress in general , and the senate republican leadership in particular , for their failure to repeal and replace obamacare , his exchange with corker went to a darker place . corker did what a lot of republican leaders have been tempted to do \u2014 question the president \u2019 s maturity and stability , and speculate how that might affect his performance as commander-in-chief .     over the last year trump has singled out for criticism two endangered gop incumbents up for re-election this year , jeff flake of arizona and dean heller of nevada . he also has engaged in an on-going feud with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell . if trump is to get anything done legislatively without having to depend on senate minority leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi , he must have the support of corker , mcconnell , flake , and heller . the opportunities to align with schumer and pelosi are likely to be few and far between .     citing three sources \u201cfamiliar with his plans , \u201d the bloomberg news article reported that bannon \u201cplans to support as many as 15 republican senate candidates in 2018 , including several challengers to incumbents . he \u2019 ll support only candidates who agree to two conditions : they will vote against mcconnell as majority leader , and they will vote to end senators \u2019 ability to block legislation by filibustering . bloomberg went on to say that only senator ted cruz of texas is safe because he \u2019 s considered sufficiently conservative and seen to be moving toward the more populist approach bannon favors .     bannon has already scored a victory in alabama by successfully backing former state supreme court chief justice roy moore against a luther strange , a senator appointed by the gop establishment . the bloomberg piece reported that bannon was targeting incumbents flake , heller , nebraska \u2019 s deb fischer , wyoming \u2019 s john barrasso , and utah \u2019 s orrin hatch , and the new york times reported on sunday that another bannon favorite , erik prince , founder of the controversial security firm blackwater , was considering a challenge to barrasso . in the event that sen. john mccain leaves office early \u2014 he is undergoing treatment for a virulent form of brain cancer \u2014 bannon has indicated a preference for paul gosar , a state representative and tea party activist . in the race to replace corker , bannon intends to support rep. marsha blackburn .     almost any conversation with congressional republicans starts and ends with the need to cut taxes , now that tax reform no longer seems possible . having failed to pass any legislation of real significance this year , and with a president who carries little weight on capitol hill , republicans desperately need to put some points on the board . they are banking on passing a tax cut that \u2019 s meaningful , that voters can see , feel , and touch . if they pass something insufficiently large , the political payoff will be commensurately small .     with 25 democratic senate seats up next year , ten in states trump carried , five in states the former real estate developer won by 19 points or more , this should be a year for the gop to expand its current narrow 52-48 majority . under different circumstances , the gop could hope to boost their senate numbers by four to seven seats , perhaps even reaching the magic 60-seat senate super-majority level that could break filibusters on party line votes . but given their current disarray , republicans will need to fight hard to gain any new seats , and losing one or two of their own seats would put their majority in jeopardy .     the stakes are even higher in the house where their majority status is in real danger . the party needs to sublimate its divisions , get mainstream republicans to the polls , and persuade the trump base to cast ballot for non-trump republicans . that \u2019 s a tall order . and it \u2019 s why last week \u2019 s news reduced the odds of the gop retaining its majority from a good bet to even money .     correction : an earlier version of this story erroneously characterized erik prince \u2019 s political plans . he is considering a run against john barrasso of wyoming . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> donald trump \u2019 s weekend twitter spat with tennessee senator bob corker is a familiar story : the president is a party of one for whom personal loyalty is the only test . he isn \u2019 t going to change , so the meaningful question is how republicans should navigate his periodic explosions to help the country and maintain their majorities in congress .     mr. trump unleashed his tirade because he is still sore that mr. corker said this summer that the president hadn \u2019 t shown the stability or competence to be successful . the two later had ... \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> advertisement     man of the hour ! bob corker , retiring republican senator from tennessee and chairman of the foreign relations committee , has been earning twitter plaudits for his sorties against president trump . he has called the president a toddler on twitter ( 134,000 retweets and counting ! ) and told the new york times that the president ' s instability might well put america \" on the path to world war iii . \"     in the scripted kabuki theater of american politics , the respected republican statesman who calls out the president of his own party as reckless or extreme is a stock character , who must always receive loud calls of adulation from the chorus of the press . bravo !     but why is it , exactly , that anyone should respect bob corker ' s opinion about the president ? should it be more , or less , respected than his endorsement of that same irresponsible toddler for the presidency ? his campaign-era praise for the foreign policy thinking of the man who he now warns risks world war iii ? his jockeying for a spot on the ticket with the toddler ? his dismissal of those who , within the republican party , were saying exactly the same things , you know , back when something could have been done about it ?     there has been a very strong correlation between bob corker ' s public comments on donald trump and bob corker ' s perceived short-term interests , and his new about-face is no exception . he only started \" uncorking \" ( get it ? ) about trump once he decided not to run for re-election in a state that trump carried by 25 points . he has calibrated his retirement announcement to encourage speculation about a 2020 bid , for which his recent comments are clearly useful in positioning him as an establishment primary challenge to trump . what is it , exactly , that anyone should respect here ?     for the record , i am not engaging in \" whataboutism . \" i absolutely agree with corker that the president of the united states behaves like a toddler and in other ways that are grave and alarming . the difference is that i haven ' t spent the past year obfuscating about that for political gain .     it ' s worth expressing some moral outrage about that . corker was an instrumental part of a republican establishment that foreswore every opportunity to stop trump during the campaign for the sake of short-term political gain : refusing to unite behind an anti-trump candidate , quashing dissent in the run-up to the convention , sucking away the oxygen that might have enabled a non-quixotic third-party conservative bid , comforting themselves with notions that the gop could \" run the country from congress \" and so it was okay to put a \" toddler \" in charge of america ' s nuclear arsenal . edmund burke was right : all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . the bob corkers of the world bear more responsibility for donald trump ' s election than the stephen bannons and sean hannitys . corker ' s \" toddler \" comment is damning \u2014 but less so for trump ( it ' s not exactly a scoop ) than for corker himself . if trump is such a toddler , why did corker enable his rise in the first place ?     but there is also an important , even fundamental , political point , here . as talleyrand , that french geopolitical master whom foreign policy hands should be able to quote , would say , \" c ' est pire qu ' un crime , c ' est une faute . \" ( \" it was worse than a crime ; it was a blunder. \" ) it is well-understood that the united states , and the west in general , is in the grips of a populist insurgency that often has noxious ideas and even more often lacks the competence to turn even its good ideas into policy . it is less well-understood that a main driver of this insurgency ' s strength is the intellectual and even , arguably , moral bankruptcy of too many in our governing elites , who often speak the language of the common good but seem to believe in little more than that the common good always intersects with their own class interest and that they have a natural right to rule . bob corker ' s sudden rediscovery of principle right at the moment when it stops being risky politically is a darkly comical symbol of this contemptible attitude .     donald trump became president at least in part because large swathes of republican voters feel screwed by their party , and they feel this way because they are , well , correct . during his senate tenure , bob corker ' s notable stances on economic policy include voting for wall street bailouts , support for a flat tax , and attacks on social security and medicare .     fixing a problem requires first understanding it . trump ' s personal behavior is contemptible and alarming , but the reason why someone like trump could get into the white house in the first place , and the way to prevent a new trump once this one is out one way or another , is to understand how and why the establishment that enabled his rise and the rise of his movement failed . there has been no hint that bob corker or those of his establishment ilk understand any of this , or plan to do anything about it other than continue to behave like the stereotype of the kind of establishment republican that drove a once-proud party ( and thence , the world ) into the hands of a fool .     trump ' s obvious psychological unfitness for his office , important though it is , is also a convenient way to distract from the fundamental failures of the republican establishment that made him possible . but on this subject bob corker has been utterly silent . i would rather hand the nuclear button to bob corker than donald trump , but if the difference between a toddler and a man is that the latter is capable to self-reflect and then take responsibility for his own actions , then the difference between these two becomes blurred .     bob corker isn ' t an opponent of donald trump . he is his enabler . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> the failing @ nytimes set liddle ' bob corker up by recording his conversation . was made to sound a fool , and that ' s what i am dealing with ! \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> should i have outed the people who said these things \u2014 or should the countless other press people who have heard similar views ? no : reporters do have to keep confidences , and i conveyed the substance of this case as best i could during the trump time capsule series through the election . moreover , it \u2019 s not clear that \u201cconcerns\ufffd ? like these would have changed anyone \u2019 s mind . during the campaign , most of trump \u2019 s fallen rivals blasted him in exceptional terms \u2014 before truckling to support him against hillary clinton . one of the most remarkable illustrations was senator ted cruz \u2019 s extended denunciation of trump as a \u201cpathological liar\ufffd ? just before trump clinched the nomination . of course cruz turned around to support him in the general election and has cast nearly all his senate votes ( 94 percent ) in alignment with trump . meanwhile , it \u2019 s not even the lead news of the week that trump \u2019 s own secretary of state has half-heartedly non-denied stephanie ruhle \u2019 s report on nbc that he called trump a \u201cfucking moron.\ufffd ?     now that bob corker , one-time supporter of trump , has taken the commendable step of going public , what \u2019 s next ?     * * *     for reporters , there is a logical extension from the opening corker has given . get mitch mcconnell , get paul ryan , get john thune and john barrasso and john cornyn , get kevin mccarthy , get every republican in a position of responsibility to answer : do you agree with your colleague that donald trump is a danger to the country and the world ? who \u2019 s right here : your comrade who is the veteran chairman of the foreign relations committee ? or a president who can \u2019 t stop tweet-threatening \u201clittle rocket man\ufffd? ? and what about corker \u2019 s claim that the white house is a daily battleground to keep the incumbent under control ? are you going to call one of your own a liar ? or is he right about trump ?     they won \u2019 t answer . knowing how not to answer comes as second nature . more smoothly than rex tillerson , they will decline to get into the \u201csilly stuff.\ufffd ? but they should be put on the spot and made to take a stand . especially the ones who will either face the voters soon \u2014 or who are deciding , as corker did recently , whether that \u2019 s even worth it .     ( to be clear : every reporter already knows these are the questions to ask , and overall the resilience of the press is one of the heartening aspects of this disheartening era . i \u2019 m just spelling out what to look for as day breaks and senators get within reporters \u2019 range. )     for congressional republicans , this is your moment in history \u2019 s eye . one of your colleagues , who has chosen not to run for office again , and who also was the object of one of trump \u2019 s intemperate attacks this morning , has decided that he might as well tell the truth . it turns out that this is often the right way to go ! as the ( slightly altered ) line from mark twain put it , by telling the truth you will gratify some people and astonish the rest . perhaps corker \u2019 s motivations are not the purest or most glorious . he was nice to trump last year , when corker was in the mentioning-cloud as a possible secretary of state , and he was part of the \u201crespectable\ufffd ? republicans who disastrous enabled trump . corker \u2019 s retorts today followed personal attacks from trump . still , he \u2019 s doing more than his colleagues have . and corker has moved toward a better place for himself in the annals of senate history than he would have had only 24 hours ago .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",
        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~> the distances are mind-boggling : in 2002 , master cpl . arron perry from the princess patricia \u2019 s canadian light infantry took aim at an afghan insurgent from a distance of 2,300 metres and hit his target , setting the world record for the longest confirmed kill shot in military history . not long after , cpl . rob furlong , in the same operation , bested his brother-in-arms with a confirmed kill at 2,430 metres . his record would stand longer , until 2009 , when a british sniper , craig harrison , made a shot from 2,475 metres .     on june 21 , harrison \u2019 s record was shattered by another canadian , an elite special forces sniper , who , according to the canadian military , killed an isis fighter in mosul from an incredible 3,540 metres .     let \u2019 s put that in perspective : if you stacked six cn towers end to end , you would still be more than 200 metres short . the bullet , according to military experts , would have travelled for nearly 10 seconds before hitting its target . the shooter not only would have had to take into consideration wind conditions , but at that distance , also the curvature of the earth .     more astonishing , perhaps , is the fact that over the last 15 years , the active-combat sniping record has been broken four times , and three of those have been by canadians .     that \u2019 s no coincidence , says furlong , who now runs a marksmanship academy in edmonton .     \u201ci \u2019 ve been saying this forever , \u201d he tells maclean \u2019 s by telephone . \u201ccanadian snipers are the best in the world . the sniper training program has been around for a long time . it \u2019 s the foundation , and it \u2019 s been retooled from lessons learned in afghanistan . we \u2019 ve built it to be the best. \u201d     this latest record , furlong adds , has taken sniping \u201cto a different level. \u201d canadian snipers are considered some of the best in the world in part because they are not simply taught to hit their targets . like much of the canadian military , many are trained with skills above their existing rank , in the sniper \u2019 s case as unit master snipers , meaning they have the skills to design and run complex operations if the need ever arises . that in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill .     the practice of equipping soldiers with more than the skills they will need on the battlefield has served the canadian military well . in afghanistan , the results were clear . maclean \u2019 s witnessed firsthand how soldiers out on patrol , sometimes for days in enemy territory , operated as closely knit teams . command decisions were made with input from different ranks , offering multiple perspectives to patrol commanders .     the level of training canada provides its soldiers , particularly its elite jtf2 commandos , is the driving force behind canada \u2019 s reputation for fielding a highly skilled and intellectually capable military .     \u201cthis is a very important point , \u201d says chris kilford , a retired canadian artillery officer and now a fellow at the queen \u2019 s university centre for international and defence policy . \u201ci have been very impressed with the young people in our special forces that i have interacted with overseas . corporals and master corporals : bright and articulate . i also think that in general our people are often capable of working at a higher level than the rank on their shoulder. \u201d     furlong agrees , adding that canadian soldiers are more \u201ccross-trained \u201d than many other soldiers in the world , and canada \u2019 s snipers specifically are given every opportunity to pursue leadership training that refines their mental capabilities , a key component to the psychologically demanding job they do .     still , there are the naysayers . warrant officer oliver cromwell , an instructor at the infantry school at cfb gagetown in new brunswick* who has taught sniper courses , cautions that more information is needed before the 3,450 meter distance is confirmed .     \u201cthere is a difference between slant angle range and true range , \u201d he says . \u201cslant angle range \u2014 if the shooter is at an elevated position relative to the target \u2014 may appear longer that the true range , sometimes twice the true distance . i don \u2019 t want to be a naysayer but those are just the facts. \u201d     some online message boards have have also questioned the validity of the new record . in one case a contributor to a military discussion suggested the sniper likely fired into a crowd of isis fighters and happened to hit one .     but furlong points out that these types of distances , 3,000 metres and more , are regularly achieved on the shooting range .     \u201cit \u2019 s not an impossible distance , \u201d he says . \u201cthe difference is between a shooting range and a battlefield . they are two completely different environments . the pressure these guys are under is huge . so to the naysayers i would just say , this can be done. \u201d     as for the men who accomplished it \u2014 snipers work in pairs , including a spotter \u2014 furlong says they probably didn \u2019 t realize what they had done until later . \u201cwhen we broke the record , we didn \u2019 t know until we got back to base , \u201d he says . \u201cto be honest , i didn \u2019 t really care , neither when i broke it or when mine was broken . records are made to be broken. \u201d     still , unless there are major advances in equipment , furlong adds , this one should stand for a long time .     correction , june 29 , 2017 : this story originally stated the location of cfb gagetown . maclean \u2019 s regrets the error . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> a canadian sniper working alongside iraqi forces in their fight against isis successfully struck a member of the militant group from a distance of 3,540 metres , canada ' s military confirmed thursday .     the sniper is a member of the elite

' ( cbc )     mitic , who was badly injured by a land mine in afghanistan in 2007 , expects the sniper team would have been working in the area for a while and would have known the conditions and terrain extremely well . he said teams like this have long been a vital part of canada ' s military operations .     \" we ' re called ' force multipliers , ' \" mitic said .     \" if you have a well-trained , well-equipped group of snipers in an area , that frees up about a hundred other troops to go and do other things . \"     canadian sniper history     canadians have held the record for longest kill shot before .     former corporal rob furlong shot a taliban fighter in afghanistan in 2002 from a distance of 2,430 metres . he broke the record set just a few days earlier by another canadian , former master corporal aaron perry , who shot an insurgent from a distance of 2,286 metres .     the history of snipers in the canadian military goes back much further . cpl . francis pegahmagabow , an ojibwa member of the 1st canadian infantry battalion , was the deadliest sniper of the first world war , with a record of 378 kills . he still stands as one of canada ' s most decorated first nations soldiers .     cpl . francis pegahmagabow , a sniper in the first world war , recorded 378 kills and is canada ' s most decorated first nations soldier .

        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~> tony leondis ' kid-flick tries to turn text-message punctuation into a colorful adventure .     here ' s what you tell yourself when you accept an assignment to review a cartoon about emoji : \" remember what you thought when you heard about the lego movie ? that it was the most shameless bit of advertising-as-entertainment you could imagine , the nadir of hollywood ' s intellectual-property dependence , and couldn ' t possibly be worth seeing ? remember how incredibly wrong you were ? \"     you were wrong then . given the right combination of inspiration , intelligence and gifted artists , any dumb thing can be turned into an enjoyable film . but tony leondis ' the emoji movie , a very , very dumb thing , comes nowhere near that magic combination . it is fast and colorful enough to attract young kids , but offers nearly nothing to their parents . if only this smartphone-centric dud , so happy to hawk real-world apps to its audience , could have done the same in its release strategy \u2014 coming out via snapchat , where it would vanish shortly after arrival . but even that wouldn ' t be fast enough .     the project ' s first hurdle is imagining how an emoji icon , which by definition represents only one emotional state ( or object ) , can be a character capable of experiencing a story . its solution is incoherent . we ' re told both that \" the pressure ' s always on \" for the face-emoji residents of textopolis to keep their expressions convincing \u2014 smiley or smirking , angry or puzzled \u2014 and that they have no choice : that weeping guy keeps gushing tears even when he wins the lottery ; he ' s just programmed that way .     the exception is gene ( voiced by t.j. miller ) , a youngster preparing to take over for his old man as the face of meh . ( who could play the elder embodiment of blah other than steven wright ? ) we learn that free-spirited gene , thanks to some glitch , is capable of infinite facial expressions . he has a hard time being deadpan on cue .     his first time on the job , in fact , he fails . in the film ' s weirdly unconvincing vision of how emojis make their way from a phone ' s inner universe to its screen when the user selects them , the whole process breaks down if one of the actors can ' t sit still for a face scan . gene wrecks the app ' s game show-like stage , and eventually , the program ' s supervisor ( smiler , a ruthless but always-smiling woman voiced by maya rudolph ) targets him for deletion , sending a team of mean-looking antivirus bots off to get him .     with the help of a high-five icon ( james corden , taking his position as the story ' s fount of unrelenting enthusiasm very seriously ) , gene sets out to find a hacker who can reprogram him and eliminate unwanted facial expressions . jailbreak ( anna faris ) says they need to escape the phone entirely to do this , getting past a tricky firewall and out onto the cloud .     getting there affords the filmmakers plenty of opportunities for product placement . the characters spend several minutes stuck in candy crush ( gags about hi-5 ' s sweet tooth go on about five times longer than they should ) ; they nearly die in a dance dance revolution-style challenge game . at best , these episodes are limp set pieces ; at worst , they sound like they were written by ad agencies . when our heroes need to ride streams of music from one place to another , one coos , \" whoa \u2014 this is spotify ? ! \" ; when jailbreak leads gene into dropbox , their pursuers can ' t follow them inside because \" this app is secure . \"     the dialogue is even lamer when the pic ' s three scribes depict the life of alex , the high-school kid who owns the phone gene inhabits . when alex wonders what to text the girl he has a crush on , his pal scowls \" words aren ' t cool \" \u2014 in a manhattan preview where critics were outnumbered by ordinary moviegoers , nearly all of the laughter was directed at this sort of line , where three grown men try and fail to convincingly imagine how kids talk . hell , they can ' t even come up with fresh-smelling one-liners about the movie ' s resident poop icon . ( amusingly , the closing credits identify this slumming actor as \" sir patrick stewart. \" )     leondis and company don ' t get much mileage out of the vast variety of emojis they might use for sight gags , but they do well enough with the slapstick adventure of gene ' s quest from home to the cloud . if not always imaginative or digestible , the look of the settings and characters should keep kids awake for 86 minutes ; and if the trick that eventually saves the day makes very little sense to critical moviegoers , at least it ' s cutely frantic eye candy . even so , few adults in the theater will have a hard time maintaining the flatline , unimpressed expression gene has such difficulty with .     production company : sony pictures animation     distributor : columbia     cast : t.j. miller , anna faris , james corden , patrick stewart , maya rudolph , steven wright , rob riggle , jennifer coolidge , jake t. austin , sofia vergara , christina aguilera     director : tony leondis     screenwriters : tony leondis , eric siegel , mike white     producer : michelle raimo kouyate     executive producer : ben waisbren     production designer : carlos zaragoza     editor : william j. caparella     composer : patrick doyle     casting director : mary hidalgo     rated pg , 86 minutes \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> the emoji movie     looking back , i \u2019 m going to go out on a limb and say that there was a small , flickering reason to believe that the emoji movie wouldn \u2019 t be a complete travesty . after all , the adorably ubiquitous pictograms that have become a second language for at least two generations are a public-domain entity ; their relative recent rise makes us forget that , licensing-wise , this is no bigger a grab than leaves : the movie would be . it was pretty much free to do whatever it wanted within the ridiculous , cynical parameters it had set . the emoji movie had nothing to sell aside from itself .     but this was na\u00efve of me , because the emoji movie is selling something . in the mock tradition of countless superior pixar films before it , it \u2019 s attempting to sell a sense of childlike wonder and fascination with an ordinary , everyday object : your smartphone . and in doing so , it is one of the darkest , most dismaying films i have ever seen , much less one ostensibly made for children .     let me get briefly more philosophical than this film deserves : emoji remain a ripe source for humor in our everyday digital parlance , specifically because they are devoid of narrative , or even , ironically , emotion . there is a kind of poetry that has emerged from their use ; an emoji is worth maybe not a thousand , but certainly a hundred words , and using one in place of words requires you to momentarily , subconsciously imagine that you are living in a language-free totalitarian state where a cry-laugh symbol is our linguistic soylent . there \u2019 s a similar pathetic humor to the constricted movement and expression of lego figurines , which the lego movie exploited to far greater effect . the emoji movie \u2019 s first aesthetic mistake is redesigning their titular figures to be the same kind of rubber-faced caricatures you can find in any other shrieking cgi kid-distracter on the market . not once does this film rise above the level of humor of literally any real-world use of a simple upside-down-face emoji ( whose meaning i tend to translate as \u201cwheeee , life is a horrible hall of mirrors and i am powerless to do anything but smile about it. \u201d )     if only my review of this film could be an upside-down-face emoji . the laboriously literal plot concerns the \u201cmeh \u201d emoji ( t.j. miller , who certainly doesn \u2019 t sound like a man who \u2019 s banking his career on this film as his game changer ) , who is \u201cdefective \u201d due to his ability to express a kaleidoscope of emotions beyond his regimented role . i think this is the basic principle behind the divergent films ; it could just as easily be about a commercial actor in an existential rut . to fix his defect , he teams up with the lowly high-five emoji ( james corden ) , who has been replaced by the newer , hipper fist-bump emoji in the hall of favorites ( racial subtext abounds ) . together they escape the messaging app they call home on a dream-logic mission to find a \u201chacker \u201d ( anna faris ) who can take them to the \u201ccloud \u201d and fix meh \u2019 s defect . along the way , they pass through a series of familiar apps while a battalion of anti-virus bots follows them in lukewarm pursuit . at one point , the film grinds to a halt for a game of candy crush .     yes , the actual ip of the emoji movie has nothing to do with the emoji themselves , and everything to do with the apps that have prime placement in the google adwords \u2013 grade narrative . somewhat relevant to the plot is the fact that it all takes place on the phone of a 14-year-old boy , who is having text-based girl troubles somehow worsened by meh \u2019 s poor performance as an emoji . apparently this 14-year-old boy not only has the usual suspects on his phone ( facebook , instagram , and spotify all make appearances ) , but also , mystifyingly , the crackle app , and extra-mystifyingly , a just dance mobile app that i wasn \u2019 t even aware existed before now and currently has a two-star rating on the apple store .     there is a mumbled , shorthand moral about staying true to yourself in all this , but it is drowned out by the wall-to-wall cynicism that is the emoji movie \u2019 s entire reason for existing in the first place . the film runs through its list of corporate and zeitgeist awareness obligations in dead-eyed lockstep , making sure to get in uses of the words \u201cslay \u201d and \u201cshade \u201d and lifting an entire section of the lyrics to rihanna \u2019 s \u201cdiamonds \u201d to telegraph a would-be important emotional beat ( it \u2019 s not a joke , i don \u2019 t think ) . in the end , meh \u2019 s embrace of his animated , multifaceted self just comes off as an ad for an emoji movie animated-sticker set that \u2019 s probably already out there .     this is a film that seems beamed from a near future in which nothing goes right ; \u201cwords , \u201d as the kids in the film agree , \u201caren \u2019 t cool \u201d anymore ; and patrick stewart making jokes about soft shits is the new prestige tv . but what do i know ? at my screening , which was for both press and a handful of unfortunate families , at the first sighting of her favorite rainbow-colored icon , a little girl behind me cried out , adoringly , \u201cit \u2019 s instagram ! \u201d a new age of heroes is born . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>you can \u2019 t judge a movie by its source material : the much-maligned jukebox musical genre gave us \u201crock of ages , \u201d yes , but it also made \u201csingin \u2019 in the rain \u201d possible . and we were all worried about \u201cthe lego movie \u201d before we saw it . so let us be clear that \u201cthe emoji movie \u201d is not a soul-crushing disaster simply because its dramatis personae are the range of emotive faces and symbols that live inside your cell phone .     it is a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor , wit , ideas , visual style , compelling performances , a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time , not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being .     on a story level , it cobbles together pieces of everything from \u201cthe wizard of oz \u201d to \u201csmurfs : the lost village \u201d ( coincidentally , sony pictures animation \u2019 s prior release ) , and thematically it hits a tediously familiar litany of kid-movie messages : be yourself . people can be more than one thing . parents should support their children . candy crush is super awesome .     watch video : ' the emoji movie ' : first trailer reveals hidden world in your smartphone     ok , that last one is a new feature , since the premise of a movie set entirely inside a smartphone has clearly opened up new potentials of product placement , whether its characters are riding boats down the musical streams of spotify or walking through other people \u2019 s photographic memories in instagram . as with sony \u2019 s \u201cthe angry birds movie , \u201d this is a film that \u2019 s shameless about its origins as a pocket doodad ; it also resembles that previous film by being completely shrill and stupid .     within the phone of a hapless high-school freshman named alex ( voiced by jake t. austin , \u201cthe fosters \u201d ) , an emoji named gene ( t.j. miller ) excitedly prepares for his first day on the job in textopolis . the \u201cexcitedly \u201d part is a problem , since gene is supposed to be a jaded \u201cmeh \u201d emoji , but he can \u2019 t stop himself from expressing a variety of emotions on his round yellow tennis-ball face .     read more see the emoji movie ' s latest power move . powerrank : 1383     his professionally underwhelmed parents , played by steven wright and jennifer coolidge , worry that his propensity for feelings will get him into trouble , and they \u2019 re right : when alex clicks on him , the scanner registers gene making a weird nonsense face , which infuriates the perpetually-cheery smiler ( maya rudolph ) , whose face bears a constant grinning rictus even when she \u2019 s calling for \u201cmalfunction \u201d gene to be deleted .     gene \u2019 s only hope is to team up with hi-5 ( james corden ) to find jailbreak ( anna faris ) , a hacker who can get them off the phone and into the cloud . anti-virus bots are eluded and lessons are learned , but to piece together the film \u2019 s dreary plotting is to give it more thought than screenwriters tony leondis ( who also directed ) , eric siegel and a presumably paycheck-collecting mike white ever did . ( and at least one of them will have to live with the fact that he wrote the dreadful pun , \u201choly delete-o ! \u201d )     also read : amazon , annapurna team up for ben stiller comedy ' brad ' s status '     the unanswered questions are legion : why do the emojis fear the phone reboot , when they \u2019 ll presumably return in its new iteration ? are they different from their counterparts in millions of other phones ? why does gene have parents when most americans are constantly switching to new and upgraded devices ? and are we really to believe that teen boy alex never uses his eggplant emoji ?     emotionally , we \u2019 re supposed to care about gene and jailbreak getting together , even though they \u2019 re so muddily conceived that we know he \u2019 s pursuing something dumb and her desires are merely vague . on top of that , we \u2019 re also supposed to be rooting for alex to win the affections of classmate addie ( tati gabrielle , \u201cthe 100 \u201d ) , but of course his courtship all boils down to picking the right emoji to text her . sorry cyrano de bergerac and abelard and heloise and cole porter and anyone else who \u2019 s ever used dumb old words to declare love ; you \u2019 re nothing without a poop symbol .     the one non-dispiriting aspect of the \u201cemoji movie \u201d experience was getting to see \u201cpuppy ! \u201d , a new animated short set in the world of \u201chotel transylvania. \u201d when adam sandler outclasses your high-concept , high-tech functions , it \u2019 s time to switch to a flip phone . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> this animated comedy takes place in textopolis , a world inside a smartphone that ' s inhabited by various emojis . there , an emoji named gene ( voiced by t.j. miller ) is ashamed that he has multiple facial expressions while his colleagues only have one each , and he embarks on a quest to be like everyone else . james corden , anna faris , jennifer coolidge , patrick stewart , and maya rudolph also lend their voices to this film from sony pictures animation .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> children should not be allowed to watch the emoji movie . their impressionable brains simply aren \u2019 t set up to sift through the thick haze of corporate subterfuge clouding every scene of this sponsored-content post masquerading as a feature film . adults know enough to snort derisively when , say , an anthropomorphic high-five drops a reference to popular smartphone game just dance now ( available for purchase in the app store , kids ! ) , but young children especially are more innocent and more vulnerable .     the emoji movie is a force of insidious evil , a film that feels as if it was dashed off by an uninspired advertising executive . the best commercials have a way of making you forget you \u2019 re being pitched at , but director tony leondis leaves all the notes received from his brand partners in full view . the core conceit apes tim burton \u2019 s the nightmare before christmas , where a spirited misfit hops between self-contained worlds styled in a single recognisable way . instead of holidays , however , our hero here jumps from app to app , and the ulterior motive of pumping up download numbers drains every last drop of joy from leondis \u2019 s efforts to enchant .     the director wants us to think of textopolis , the bustling city inside our smartphones , as a world of pure imagination . when a meh-face emoji named gene ( tj miller ) is banished from his home for daring to express an emotion other than unimpressed nonchalance , leondis takes his odyssey of self-discovery as an opportunity to imagine fantastical scenery . as a smiley-face emoji ( maya rudolph ) ruling textopolis with a cheery iron fist tirelessly hunts him down , gene gapes in awe at such marvels as a supercharged rollercoaster ride through raw data and a pixelated humpback whale that majestically glides over him . but because these glossy images are so nakedly in service of plugs for dropbox and spotify , it \u2019 s all but impossible to appreciate any incidental beauty they might possess .     facebook twitter pinterest alex , voiced by jake t austin , in the emoji movie . photograph : sony pictures/ap     the pervasive falseness extends to the film \u2019 s thematic underpinnings , which make a clumsy lunge at vague , be-yourself positivity . the paramount importance of being true to one \u2019 s own spirit is made literal in gene \u2019 s silly quandary ; he \u2019 s forced to hide who he is for the sake of compulsory homogeneity , and only through tapping into his full range of emotions can he achieve his potential . while leondis , who is gay , has stated he intends this as an allegory for the tribulations faced by the non-heterosexual community , any social commentary is stymied by the execution . the film \u2019 s insistent feel-goodery and occasional nods to feminism ( delivered by a spunky blue-haired hacker emoji , voiced by anna faris ) ring false . product-placement mashups toy story and the lego movie had the purity of playtime to seal in the sentimentality ; somehow it \u2019 s not as endearing in a film built around the apps we use to kill time while sat on the toilet .     the ruthless mercenary details take the emoji movie beyond simply embarrassing and incompetent into something more manipulative and contemptible . one perplexing scene finds the emoji pals all doing a synchronised dance called \u201cthe emoji bop \u201d . in a film so desperate to sell itself , this is clearly a craven bid to go viral , the cinematic equivalent of clickbait . the script practically begs for the approval of the tweens that elevated the lowly emoji to phenomenon status , but has only the slightest notion how they talk or act . alex ( jake t austin ) , the human in possession of the phone housing gene and the rest of the cast , speaks like an dusty oldster . alex \u2019 s awkward courtship of the cute girl in his class revolves around the deployment of emojis , but demonstrates no workable understanding of how the icons fit into adolescent life . watching this fogeyish hero angle for edgy relevance is as uncomfortable as reading a fast-food chain \u2019 s twitter account .     however , the most disturbing part of this toxic film is the way it infects audiences with its ugly cynicism . a viewer leaves the emoji movie a colder person , not only angry at the film for being unconscionably bad , but resentful of it for making them feel angry . a critic can accept the truth that art and commerce will spend eternity locked in opposition . nevertheless it \u2019 s still startling to see art that cheers commerce on while being stamped in the face by its boots . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",
        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~> susan rice speaks during a conference on the transition of the u.s. presidency from barack obama to donald trump at the u.s. institute of peace , jan. 10.     susan rice speaks during a conference on the transition of the u.s. presidency from barack obama to donald trump at the u.s. institute of peace , jan. 10. photo : agence france-presse/getty images     well , what do you know . on the matter of who \u201cunmasked \u201d the names of trump transition officials in u.s. intelligence reports , we now have one answer : susan rice , barack obama \u2019 s national security adviser .     a u.s. intelligence official confirms to us the bombshell news , first reported monday by bloomberg , that ms. rice requested the name of at least one trump transition official listed in an intelligence report in the months between election day and donald trump \u2019 s inauguration .     ms. rice received summaries of u.s. eavesdropping either when foreign officials were discussing the trump team , or when foreign officials were conversing with a trump transition member . the surveillance was legally authorized , but the identities of u.s. citizens are typically masked so they cannot be known outside intelligence circles . ms. rice asked for and learned the identity of the trump official , whose name hasn \u2019 t been publicly disclosed and our source declined to share .     potomac watch podcast     our source did confirm that ms. rice also examined dozens of other intelligence summaries that technically masked trump official identities but were written in such a way as to make obvious who those officials were . this means that the masking was essentially meaningless . all this is highly unusual \u2014 and troubling . unmasking does occur , but it is typically done by intelligence or law-enforcement officials engaged in antiterror or espionage investigations . ms. rice would have had no obvious need to unmask trump campaign officials other than political curiosity .     we \u2019 re told by a source who has seen the unmasked documents that they included political information about the trump transition team \u2019 s meetings and policy intentions . we are also told that none of these documents had anything to do with russia or the fbi investigation into ties between russia and the trump campaign . while we don ' t know if ms. rice requested these dozens of reports , we are told that they were only distributed to a select group of recipients \u2014 conveniently including ms. rice .     all of this helps to explain the actions in the last week of house intelligence chairman devin nunes , the one official in washington who seems interested in pursuing the evidence of politicized surveillance . mr. nunes was roundly criticized by democrats and the media last week for publicly revealing at least one instance of obama white house unmasking , albeit without disclosing any names .     now we know he is onto something . and we know that mr. nunes had to go to the white house to verify his information because the records containing ms. rice \u2019 s unmasking request are held at the national security council .     where are the civil libertarians when you really need them ? these columns support broad surveillance powers for national security , but executive officials need to be accountable if those powers are abused . if congressional oversight of u.s. intelligence operations is going to be worth the name , then it should include the unmasking of a political opponent by a senior official in the white house .     democrats certainly raised a fuss during the bush years and after edward snowden kicked off the debate about \u201cmetadata , \u201d which are merely telephone numbers without names . oregon senator ron wyden went so far as to introduce a bill in 2013 to strengthen the ban on \u201creverse targeting \u201d \u2014 in which intelligence agencies surveil foreigners but with the goal of capturing u.s. citizen communications .     yet now that there \u2019 s evidence that the obama administration may have unmasked trump officials , democrats couldn \u2019 t care less . adam schiff , the ranking democrat on house intelligence , has spent the past week denouncing mr. nunes for revealing that a name was unmasked and for having sources at the white house . but he hasn \u2019 t raised a peep about the unmasking itself or who was behind it .     the news about ms. rice \u2019 s unmasking role raises a host of questions for the senate and house intelligence committees to pursue . what specific surveillance information did ms. rice seek and why ? was this information related to president obama \u2019 s decision in january to make it possible for raw intelligence to be widely disbursed throughout the government ? was this surveillance of trump officials \u201cincidental \u201d collection gathered while listening to a foreigner , or were some trump officials directly targeted , or \u201creverse targeted \u201d ?     we were unable to locate ms. rice monday to ask for comment , and she hasn \u2019 t addressed the unmasking as far as we know . but asked last month on the \u201cpbs newshour \u201d that trump officials might have been surveilled , she said , \u201ci know nothing about this \u201d and \u201ci was surprised to see reports from chairman nunes on that account today. \u201d she certainly deserves her turn under oath on capitol hill .     none of this should deter investigators from looking into the trump-russia connection . by all means follow that evidence where it leads . but the media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the obama administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes . americans deserve to know the truth about both .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>multiple sources tell fox news that susan rice , former national security adviser under then-president barack obama , requested to unmask the names of trump transition officials caught up in surveillance .     the unmasked names , of people associated with donald trump , were then sent to all those at the national security council , some at the defense department , then-director of national intelligence james clapper and then-cia director john brennan \u2013 essentially , the officials at the top , including former rice deputy ben rhodes .     the names were part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and president-elect trump and people close to him , including family members , for up to a year before he took office .     expand / contract rice was ambassador to the un when she went on sunday news shows to say the benghazi attack was prompted by a video . ( fox news photo )     it was not clear how rice knew to ask for the names to be unmasked , but the question was being posed by the sources late monday .     such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends . \" spied on before nomination . \" the real story . \u2014 donald j. trump ( @realdonaldtrump ) april 3 , 2017     \" what i know is this ... if the intelligence community professionals decide that there \u2019 s some value , national security , foreign policy or otherwise in unmasking someone , they will grant those requests , \" former obama state department spokeswoman and fox news contributor marie harf told fox news ' martha maccallum on \" the first 100 days . \" \" and we have seen no evidence ... that there was partisan political notice behind this and we can \u2019 t say that unless there \u2019 s actual evidence to back that up . \"     white house press secretary sean spicer , asked about the revelations at monday \u2019 s briefing , declined to comment specifically on what role rice may have played or officials \u2019 motives .     expand / contract rep. devin nunes , r-calif. , says he has seen incidental surveillance reports he fears were used for political reasons . ( the associated press )     \u201ci \u2019 m not going to comment on this any further until [ congressional ] committees have come to a conclusion , \u201d he said , while contrasting the media \u2019 s alleged \u201clack \u201d of interest in these revelations with the intense coverage of suspected trump-russia links .     when names of americans are incidentally collected , they are supposed to be masked , meaning the name or names are redacted from reports \u2013 whether it is international or domestic collection , unless it is an issue of national security , crime or if their security is threatened in any way . there are loopholes and ways to unmask through backchannels , but americans are supposed to be protected from incidental collection . sources told fox news that in this case , they were not .     this comes in the wake of evelyn farkas \u2019 television interview last month in which the former obama deputy secretary of defense said in part : \u201ci was urging my former colleagues and , frankly speaking , the people on the hill \u2013 it was more actually aimed at telling the hill people , get as much information as you can , get as much intelligence as you can , before president obama leaves the administration. \u201d     meanwhile , fox news also is told that house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes knew about unmasking and leaking back in january , well before president trump \u2019 s tweet in march alleging wiretapping .     nunes has faced criticism from democrats for viewing pertinent documents on white house grounds and announcing their contents to the press . but sources said \u201cthe intelligence agencies slow-rolled nunes . he could have seen the logs at other places besides the white house scif [ secure facility ] , but it had already been a few weeks . so he went to the white house because he could protect his sources and he could get to the logs. \u201d     as the obama administration left office , it also approved new rules that gave the nsa much broader powers by relaxing the rules about sharing intercepted personal communications and the ability to share those with 16 other intelligence agencies .     rice is no stranger to controversy . as the u.s. ambassador to the un , she appeared on several sunday news shows to defend the adminstration ' s later debunked claim that the sept. 11 , 2012 attacks on a u.s. consulate in libya was triggered by an internet video .     rice also told abc news in 2014 that army sgt . bowe bergdahl \" served the united states with honor and distinction \" and that he \" wasn ' t simply a hostage ; he was an american prisoner of war captured on the battlefield . \"     bergdahl is currently facing court-martial on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy

reports that related to trump transition activities . he brought this to the attention of the white house general counsel ' s office , who reviewed more of rice ' s requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy .     the intelligence reports were summaries of monitored conversations -- primarily between foreign officials discussing the trump transition , but also in some cases direct contact between members of the trump team and monitored foreign officials . one u.s. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the trump transition such as whom the trump team was meeting , the views of trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration .     rice did not respond to an email seeking comment on monday morning . her role in requesting the identities of trump transition officials adds an important element to the dueling investigations surrounding the trump white house since the president ' s inauguration .     both the house and senate intelligence committees are probing any ties between trump associates and a russian influence operation against hillary clinton during the election . the chairman of the house intelligence committee , representative devin nunes , is also investigating how the obama white house kept tabs on the trump transition after the election through unmasking the names of trump associates incidentally collected in government eavesdropping of foreign officials .     rice herself has not spoken directly on the issue of unmasking . last month when she was asked on the \" pbs newshour \" about reports that trump transition officials , including trump himself , were swept up in incidental intelligence collection , rice said : \" i know nothing about this , \" adding , \" i was surprised to see reports from chairman nunes on that account today . \"     rice ' s requests to unmask the names of trump transition officials do not vindicate trump ' s own tweets from march 4 in which he accused obama of illegally tapping trump tower . there remains no evidence to support that claim .     but rice ' s multiple requests to learn the identities of trump officials discussed in intelligence reports during the transition period does highlight a longstanding concern for civil liberties advocates about u.s. surveillance programs . the standard for senior officials to learn the names of u.s. persons incidentally collected is that it must have some foreign intelligence value , a standard that can apply to almost anything . this suggests rice ' s unmasking requests were likely within the law .     the news about rice also sheds light on the strange behavior of nunes in the last two weeks . it emerged last week that he traveled to the white house last month , the night before he made an explosive allegation about trump transition officials caught up in incidental surveillance . at the time he said he needed to go to the white house because the reports were only on a database for the executive branch . it now appears that he needed to view computer systems within the national security council that would include the logs of rice ' s requests to unmask u.s. persons .     the ranking democrat on the committee nunes chairs , representative adam schiff , viewed these reports on friday . in comments to the press over the weekend he declined to discuss the contents of these reports , but also said it was highly unusual for the reports to be shown only to nunes and not himself and other members of the committee .     indeed , much about this is highly unusual : if not how the surveillance was collected , then certainly how and why it was disseminated .     this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion

at the weekend that grounded flights at heathrow and gatwick , but denied the disruption had anything to do with cost-cutting in the business .     giving his first media interview since a major outage caused the airline \u2019 s it system to collapse last saturday , he refused to resign and said the problem was not a result of outsourcing jobs to other countries .     \u201ci can confirm

promising not to allow such an outage to happen again .     the it failure was caused by a short but catastrophic power surge at 9.30am that affected the company \u2019 s messaging system , he said , and the backup system failed to work properly .     \u201cwe will have completed an exhaustive investigation on exactly the reasons of why this happened , \u201d mr cruz said . \u201cwe will , of

cent of its flights on monday from the two major london hubs , but 27 departures and arrivals were already cancelled on the day , and 58 were delayed .     after the outage caused more than 1,000 flights to be delayed or cancelled , including ba \u2019 s sister airlines in spain , iberia and air nostrum , focus quickly turned to mr cruz \u2019 s handling of the company , having shut down the

terminals .     ba has not explained the cause of the power problem .     so far on monday , 13 short-haul flights at heathrow have been cancelled .     heathrow advised affected ba passengers not to travel to the airport unless their flights had been rebooked , or were scheduled to take off today .     passengers on cancelled flights have been told to use the ba website to rebook .     chief executive alex cruz has posted videos on twitter apologising for what he called a \" horrible time for passengers \" .     but no-one from the airline has been made available to answer questions about the system crash , and it has not explained why there was no back-up system in place .     cancellations and delays affected thousands of passengers at both heathrow and gatwick on saturday .     all

disaster recovery plan should have whirred into action . but that will have depended in part on veteran staff with knowledge of the complex patchwork of systems built up over the years .     many of those people may have left when much of the it operation was outsourced to india .     one theory of the it expert , who does not wish to be named , is that when the power came back on the systems were unusable because the data was unsynchronised .     in other words the airline was suddenly faced with a mass of conflicting records of passengers , aircraft and baggage movements - all the complex logistics of modern air travel .     read the full blog     ba said it operated virtually all scheduled long-haul flights on sunday , but the knock-on effects of saturday ' s disruption

\" high-value city \" like london may be able to claim more and should keep all receipts .     but he added that it might be harder for passengers to claim compensation , as ba may blame \"

it wears thin quickly and once it has worn out , we \u2019 re left with warmed-over dashiell hammett , complete with the sam spade-inspired voiceover .     recognizing that there has to be something more than muppets cursing , flashing their crotches in imitation of sharon stone in basic instinct , and doing un-family friendly things , henson sets up the puppet culture as a thinly-veiled allegory . the social commentary about puppet discrimination and marginalization isn \u2019 t subtle but it gives the happytime murders a claim to being more than a raunchy look at what happens on sesame street when the cameras are turned off .     the happytime murders reunites two former partners , ( human ) lapd detective connie edwards ( melissa mccarthy ) and ( puppet ) pi phil phillips ( voice of bill barretta ) , when an investigation into a series of puppet murders involves them both . for connie , it \u2019 s her job . for phil , it \u2019 s personal \u2013 his brother is the second victim . all of the dead \u201csocks \u201d were stars of a once-popular tv show , the happytime gang ( the first program with a mostly-puppet cast to achieve \u201ccrossover \u201d popularity \u2013 a nod to the cosby show ) . additional deaths indicate an inside job and , once the finger of suspicion points to phil , it \u2019 s up to connie to solve the crime and clear her ex-partner . aiding her in this endeavor is phil \u2019 s secretary , bubbles ( maya rudolph ) , who has a crush on her boss .     the film \u2019 s puppet/human dynamics are strange . all the energy and color resides with the puppets . in an odd reversal of what one might expect , they are more animate than their human counterparts . melissa mccarthy , for example , has the life of a piece of background furniture \u2013 a surprise since , even in her worst films , she \u2019 s normally able to dominate the screen . fading into the background isn \u2019 t her style but that \u2019 s what happens here . the situation is only a little better with maya rudolph and elizabeth banks ( whose role , as the happytime gang \u2019 s only human , is small ) . leslie david baker ( as connie \u2019 s lieutenant ) and joel mchale ( as a racist fbi agent ) gain attention by being as cartoonish as possible .     the noir mystery element never works . fortunately , it \u2019 s treated as a framework and the filmmakers aren \u2019 t overly invested in attempting to mine deeply into the territory . the happytime murders is intended primarily as a comedy and , while there \u2019 s a cheeky freshness in the early scenes , it eventually becomes tiresome and a little off-putting . this would seem like the perfect playground for mccarthy , so it \u2019 s strange that she seems so out of place .     the obvious antecedent to the happytime murders is who framed roger rabbit ? the differences , however , go beyond the derivative nature of the former . while roger rabbit felt like a fully-formed story worth telling , the happytime murders too often comes across as a skit that runs for too long . everything about the movie is stunted \u2013 from the running time to the production values to the story . although it might work perfectly well on television ( there are enough bawdy laughs to ensure an acceptable level of entertainment ) , it never gels on the big screen . this is unquestionably a better bet for home viewing than a trip to a theater .             happytime murders , the ( united states/china , 2018 ) \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> 1.5 stars ( out of 4 )     hi there , everyone ! this happytime murders review is brought to you by the letter \u201ci. \u201d insipid . imbeciles . incomprehensible . insane . you can use that last word in a sentence such as \u201cthe person that thought this witless , crude black noire puppet farce would be a rousing crowd-pleaser must be insane. \u201d the letter also can be used on its own , as in \u201ci think we have a strong contender for the worst film of 2018. \u201d     let \u2019 s address the stuffed elephant in the room : this scathing review isn \u2019 t a case of a critic not having the bawdy sense of humor gene required to appreciate crass humor , ok ? married with children and howard stern are two of my all-time favorite pop culture touchstones . i have a brother . i \u2019 m not offended or shocked by the sight of two puppets having porn star sex . just make it brutally funny and inspired . the happytime murders simply goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy from beginning to end . and those 90 minutes in between are excruciating . let me put it in italics for emphasis . excruciating .     this was never going to be a genius hybrid of avenue q meets the great muppet caper . not with this old-timey set-up : hard-nosed detective phil phillips ( voiced by bill barretta ) is the only puppet to have ever served on the police force . now he \u2019 s a private eye working on behalf of marginalized puppets in los angeles . after his brother gets stuffed out , he starts investigating and realizes that someone is killing all the stars of a popular 80s kids tv show called the happytime gang . who would do such a thing ? !     to solve the case , phil is paired with his former human partner . she \u2019 s played by melissa mccarthy , who does her usual obnoxious , tough-talking caricature shtick . the two are not on good terms , as evidenced by the fact that mccarthy bites down on phil \u2019 s man part in a moment of pent-up rage . the novelty of puppets acting like lewd rejects from sausage party or team america : world police is already worn off by the time mccarthy enters the picture . she does nothing with the limp script . same goes for maya rudolph , joel mchale and elizabeth banks .     the tangled web of the happytime gang syndication contract negotiations won \u2019 t raise anyone \u2019 s pulse , so the filmmakers ( writer todd berger and director brian henson ) rely heavily on the r-rated shock factor . the piece de resistance , as seen in the happytime murders trailer , involves a graphic and messy sexual encounter that drags on and on and on until all traces of laughter have been metaphorically squeezed out . you \u2019 ll see that in act 1. or , you know , just watch the trailer for free .     there actually is a place and time for puppets behaving badly . even a family-driven product as accessible as the muppet show had an air of subversion \u2014 and kermit the frog and justin timberlake once wrestled each other on a memorable episode of saturday night live . but despite henson \u2019 s lineage as the son of late muppets creator ( and genius ) jim henson , the happytime murders is a terribly misguided move . indeed , it doesn \u2019 t take an investigator with a heart of felt to figure out that a half-baked flick with poorly executed ideas and lazy use of gross-out humor will end up doa .     the

murders , \u201d the wretched puppets-behaving-badly comedy directed by brian henson .     the son of muppets creator jim henson has delivered a clich\u00e9-ridden , laughless bore that wastes lead actress melissa mccarthy \u2019 s prodigious comic talents and beats well-trod territory with a mallet .     \u201cthe happytime murders \u201d is as fresh as the old \u201cwayne \u2019 s world \u201d jokes it shoves in . it \u2019 s a movie in which puppet crabs make cracks about getting pelvic crabs , and the line \u201clooks like the carpet doesn \u2019 t match the drapes \u201d is uttered twice .     as stale as a neglected saltine , the flick is another police-noir parody with all the familiar hallmarks : brooding narration , a cigarette-smoke-filled office , a door with a frosted window and a helpless blond bombshell . think \u201cwho framed roger rabbit \u201d minus the innovation or fun .     the bawdy tale is set in a decrepit los angeles that \u2019 s plagued by crime , and where our felt-y friends are an oppressed minority . kids yell \u201cstupid puppet ! \u201d and beat them up , while the word \u201csock \u201d is now a racial slur .     the smoky office belongs to phil philips ( bill barretta ) , a puppet private investigator and former cop . he was kicked off the lapd years earlier when , his bosses believe , he purposefully didn \u2019 t gun down a puppet perp . his human partner , detective connie edwards ( mccarthy ) , was nearly killed in the botched operation .     that bumbling duo is thrust back together when puppet and human cast members of popular tv show \u201cthe happytime gang , \u201d including phil \u2019 s famous stuffed brother , start getting killed off one by one . he goes rogue to solve the case with connie .     what \u2019 s not solved is the film \u2019 s no . 1 problem : it \u2019 s not funny .     most bits are either gross or groaners . a gag involving boudoir silly string is amusing until it becomes nauseating . watching mccarthy snort puppet crack didn \u2019 t make me crack a smile . the only cast member who earns some giggles is maya rudolph as phil \u2019 s secretary , who \u2019 s secretly in love with him . she \u2019 s a comedy alchemist who can turn turds into gold .     \u201cthe happytime murders \u201d is the latest addition to mccarthy \u2019 s do-not-see cv . since \u201cbridesmaids , \u201d filmmakers have slapped her in mostly dumb schlock like this .     being a henson project , you \u2019 d expect the film \u2019 s puppetry to be the one redeemable factor . but those characters are strangely generic and clumsily handled . forgettable .     there \u2019 s more fun to be had watching a kid play with some socks . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>close director

that \u2019 s what we want to be doing. \u201d     the mission represents a marked change for the popular news host whose prosecutor-like style in fox news channel \u2019 s primetime made her a star . kelly has no experience hosting a morning program of this sort , and just months ago was anchoring a sunday-night newsmagazine program on nbc that at times proved polarizing . but she put all of that in the rear-view mirror monday as she re-introduced herself to the audience , talking about her upstate new york roots and introducing her husband and mother to the in-studio crowd and the audience at home . it \u2019 s a technique that was put to good use by nbc colleague jimmy fallon in the opening moments of his run on the network \u2019 s late-night franchise \u201ctonight. \u201d     related nbc touts megyn kelly \u2019 s softer side in bid to launch new morning show to lure ad dollars , nbc tied megyn kelly to \u2018today \u2019     nbc is packaging kelly as part of its \u201ctoday \u201d empire . she \u2019 s coming on after colleagues matt lauer and savannah guthrie deliver most of the headlines \u2013 and a lot of lighter fare , as well . and she \u2019 s on before hoda kotb and kathie lee gifford start sipping wine and delving into less serious topics . as the rest of the \u201ctoday \u201d anchors came on set to toast her , kelly offered the assemblage mimosas , meant to represent a transition between the wake-you-up coffee served on the show \u2019 s first two hours and the alcohol consumed in its last . but there was no talk of current events : no reference to the devastation in puerto rico , or the protests that took place over the weekend across the nation \u2019 s various nfl games .     kelly has long harbored ambitions of filling in the space in the tv-news business once occupied by barbara walters or oprah winfrey . \u201cdiane sawyer left her anchor role . oprah has moved to the own network and is doing a different thing now . so why not me ? \u201d she told variety during an interview in 2015.     on monday , she dove into the role , hosting a multi-segment visit with the cast of \u201cwill &amp; grace , \u201d the popular nbc sitcom that is getting a reboot this season . she bantered with the rest of the \u201ctoday \u201d crew in a taped segment that had kelly biking to work with al roker , and getting advice from kathie lee gifford ( \u201cbe authentic ! \u201d ) as she sat in the makeup chair . the show ended with a long field piece that had kelly journey to the windy city to meet a 77-year-old chicago nun who was working diligently to improve a tough neighborhood . sister donna liette and some of her supporters also joined kelly in the studio . the title of the segment , \u201csettle for more , \u201d is borrowed from kelly \u2019 s recent memoir , and looks as if it might be a regular feature on the show about people trying to improve their situation in life . \u201cif you want change , you must seek it , \u201d kelly told the crowd .     nbc managed to weave promotional support from advertisers into the opening program \u2013 much like oprah winfrey did over the years . and while there was no mass giveaway of new cars to the in-studio crowd , as winfrey did in 2004 when she gave free pontiacs to more than 250 audience members , kelly was able to offer one man a free trip to california to see a \u201cwill &amp; grace \u201d taping , courtesy of united airlines . coldwell banker and ace hardware coughed up checks on stage to help sister liette continue her work . unilever and general mills were among the sponsors running multiple commercials during kelly \u2019 s debut .     daytime tv is notoriously difficult , and reliable operatives including anderson cooper , katie couric and meredith vieira have faced headwinds in their attempts to launch programs similar to kelly \u2019 s . nbc is clearly hoping the force of her personality and an inspirational backstory lend the host an edge \u2013 not the polarizing kind \u2013 with a broader audience that it was reaching with the previous inhabitant of the 9 a.m. timeslot .     will kelly be able to maintain the lighter , inspirational tone of her debut in a swirling news cycle that seems utterly consumed with politics and cultural clashes ? will she want to bring her hard-news chops to bear now and again ? the magic of a morning program is that it always has another broadcast waiting in the wings that might allow its host to try those ideas out . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> kelly ' s much-anticipated new show , ' megyn kelly today , ' debuted monday .     megyn kelly , in a series of prelaunch interviews , has been very clear about the show she wants to run every day at 9 a.m. on nbc \u2014 one that ' s light on politics but heavy on inspiration and fun . she followed through on that early vision with the monday morning launch of megyn kelly today , which replaces the 9 a.m. hour of today .     \" as you heard , we have the entire cast of will &amp; grace live , along with the show creator , \" kelly told her live studio audience . \" and then we ' ll be dissecting the latest tweet from president trump !

' ( photo : peter kramer , nbc )     megyn kelly is \" done with politics for now . \"     the host opened monday ' s inaugural episode of megyn kelly today , the 9 a.m. hour of nbc ' s today show , with that declarative statement . she noted that politics are everywhere , infused into every facet of our lives , and her new morning show would be far more focused on \" fun . \"     it was a bit of necessary rebranding for the former fox news anchor , who made her name diving into politics headfirst on the cable news channel , to enter the more lifestyle-focused world of morning tv .     minus politics , monday ' s premiere was a blend of personal stories from kelly , an audience q&a , celebrity interviews and an \" inspirational \" field piece to close out the hour .     more : ' megyn kelly today ' : ' it ' s not going to be the trump channel , ' she promises     the combination is tricky , and the first episode was a bit awkward . like any new series , megyn has some growing pains , and that was apparent in missed cues , clumsy seating arrangements and some stiffness from kelly , who , whether because of nervousness or her attempts to develop a new tone , speaks with a strange cadence .     and even an hour of the today show cannot divorce itself from politics entirely . her first guests were the cast and creators of nbc ' s returning will &amp; grace , which , as kelly repeatedly explained , was a groundbreaking show for lgbtq representation on television . kelly focused on the impact the series had on that community , except she only mentioned \" gays and lesbians , \" and , in an ill-timed joke that didn ' t land , asked a superfan in the audience , \" is it true you became a lawyer and gay because of will &amp; grace \" ?     kelly also devoted a segment to an elderly nun working against gun violence on the south side of chicago , an area that kelly called \" like a war zone . \" chicago ' s gun violence is another issue that ' s been politicized , particularly by president trump , but her focus is on the feel-good aspect of the nun ' s \" peace garden , \" and her efforts to bring the mothers of violence victims and perpetrators together . while that serves its own purpose , it doesn ' t make the issue entirely apolitical .     that , perhaps , is the biggest hurdle . she can say that she ' s done with politics , but the subject is ( by her own admission ) everywhere , and side-stepping it won ' t make it go away . the show will get better at staging and timing as it goes on , but a purpose is something harder to refine .     there ' s a difference between choosing to focus on lifestyle and entertainment over political news , and ignoring the fact that politics exist in everyday issues . megyn kelly today would do well to strike a better balance .      https://usat.ly/2yoaohg\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word summary about the given articles.>>ANSWER<<",
        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~>her letter , which was read in court defending brock turner , sparked national outrage from people who said it perpetuated rape culture and blamed victims     a woman who blamed a stanford university sexual assault victim for drinking too much alcohol has issued a defensive apology , marking the latest controversy surrounding an athlete who avoided prison time for attacking an unconscious woman .     leslie rasmussen , a childhood friend of former stanford swimmer brock turner , who was convicted of three felonies , wrote a letter to the judge saying that the assault was \u201ca huge misunderstanding \u201d , turner is \u201cnot a monster \u201d , and that she thought it was unfair \u201cto base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn \u2019 t remember anything \u201d .     stanford sexual assault : dozens of letters to judge urge leniency for brock turner read more     her statement continued : \u201cwhere do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn \u2019 t always because people are rapists. \u201d the letter \u2013 a selection of which the judge read in court , saying it was a useful reference that highlighted turner \u2019 s strong character \u2013 went viral this week , sparking national outrage from people who said it perpetuated rape culture and cast blame on victims .     in the wake of significant backlash , northside festival , a new york music showcase , announced tuesday that it had dropped rasmussen \u2019 s band from its lineup , and her group , good english , has now released an apology from rasmussen .     the 20-year-old \u2019 s letter of support for turner was one of dozens submitted to the judge , aaron persky , who is facing a recall campaign for giving the defendant a light sentence . although a jury determined , based on witness testimony , that turner had sexually assaulted an unconscious woman outside a fraternity party on campus , persky ordered a sentence of six months in county jail , instead of the minimum two years in prison prescribed by law .     in a statement good english shared with the guardian , rasmussen said she wanted the judge to \u201cconsider the effect that alcohol played in this tragedy \u201d , adding :     i understand that this appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests i sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that i blame the victim involved . nothing could be farther from the truth , and i apologize for anything my statement has done to suggest that i don \u2019 t feel enormous sympathy for the victim and her suffering \u2026 there is nothing more sad than the unnecessary , destructive and enormous toll that overuse , misuse and abuse of alcohol and drugs play in people \u2019 s lives , and i don \u2019 t think my effort to point this out in confidence to a judge while commenting on brock turner \u2019 s character , as the sober person i knew him to be , was an irresponsible or reckless decision . unfortunately , due to the overzealous nature of social media and the lack of confidence and privacy in which my letter to the judge was held , i am now thrust into the public eye to defend my position on this matter in the court of public opinion .     unlike her original letter , rasmussen acknowledged the \u201cenormous pain \u201d of the victim and said turner was \u201ctried and rightfully convicted of sexual assault \u201d .     the band \u2013 which posted the apology on facebook and subsequently deleted the page \u2013 declined to comment further .         after publication of this article , rasmussen posted a second apology on her personal facebook page , saying it was wrong for her to make assumptions about what happened that night .     \u201cmost importantly , i did not acknowledge strongly enough the severity of brock \u2019 s crime and the suffering and pain that his victim endured , and for that lack of acknowledgement , i am deeply sorry .     i fully understand the outrage over brock \u2019 s sentencing and my statement . i can only say that i am committed to learning from this mistake . i am 20 years old , and it has never been more clear to me that i still have much to learn. \u201d     rasmussen \u2019 s letter was part of the court record of character references persky considered before sentencing , and activists and supporters of the victim said they were appalled that the judge , who is a former stanford athlete , placed so much weight on the references and the impact the trial has had on turner .     michele dauber , a stanford law professor and family friend of the victim , said it was important that these letters be exposed considering that the judge used them to justify leniency .     \u201cshe says in the letter that rapists don \u2019 t cause rape . that \u2019 s ridiculous , \u201d said dauber , who posted an excerpt of rasmussen \u2019 s letter on twitter and is leading the recall campaign against the judge . \u201ci \u2019 m shocked that the judge found that to be persuasive. \u201d     michele dauber ( @mldauber ) #brockturner court probation report is fetid pond of victim-blaming rapeyness @thehuntinground @hodgman @brielarson pic.twitter.com/hygboyov9q     citing rasmussen \u2019 s references to \u201cbeing politically correct \u201d , dauber added , \u201cif that \u2019 s what this judge thinks is a good argument , then i think we need to get that out in front of the voters. \u201d     dauber noted that the character witnesses participated in a \u201cpublic process \u201d , adding , \u201cthey wanted to help their friend , and it was very effective . he was not sentenced to prison. \u201d     turner \u2019 s own testimony blaming the assault on \u201cparty culture \u201d and his father \u2019 s statement that his son is paying a steep price for \u201c20 minutes of action \u201d have also attracted widespread criticisms .     the judge has declined to comment while an appeal in the case is pending .     the case originally received international attention when the 23-year-old victim released a powerful statement about rape culture and the suffering she has endured throughout the process .     \u2022 two quotes in this article were amended on 8 june at the request of michele dauber . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> photo : courtesy of the santa clara county sheriff     while brock turner , the ex-stanford student who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman behind a dumpster last year , has formally been sentenced on three counts of felony sexual assault , he is not being described as a convicted rapist in the media . many people have been asking why . here \u2019 s your answer . warning : it \u2019 s pretty unsatisfying .     in california , rape is defined as someone using \u201cphysical force , intimidation , duress , or threats to persuade the victim to engage in sexual intercourse. \u201d in the case of turner \u2019 s rape of an unconscious woman , witnesses and testimony determined that turner penetrated his victim with a foreign object , not a sexual organ . his victim , who read powerful testimony in court directly addressing turner , explained what she learned after the attack :     never mentioned me voicing consent , never mentioned us even speaking , a back rub . one more time , in public news , i learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside , my breasts had been groped , fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris , my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster , while an erect freshman was humping my half naked , unconscious body . but i don \u2019 t remember , so how do i prove i didn \u2019 t like it .     in the eyes of the law , what turner did to his victim is considered sexual assault and not rape , no matter how horrific it sounds . the three charges turner was convicted of are \u201cassault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman , sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object , and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. \u201d     intent to commit rape , legally , is not the same as sexually penetrating a person , and therefore , turner is not being described as a convicted rapist . but he is now a registered sex offender for the rest of his life .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> former stanford swimmer brock turner , who was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on campus , exhibited concerning behavior before with other women , according to sentencing documents .     at a party the night the victim was sexually assaulted , a woman said turner suddenly grabbed her and kissed her , the court documents show . the woman then turned and pushed him away , describing the interaction as \" odd \" because they had not talked much and there was no flirtation .     later that night , turner came back and tried to kiss her a second time as she was talking to a friend . he put his hands on her waist , and she \" had to move away from him , \" the sentencing document said .     on june , 25 2015 , detectives received information about two women who encountered turner the weekend before the sexual assault took place . the woman attended a ka fraternity party on the weekend of jan. 9 , 2015 , where one of the women was introduced to turner .     the woman said turner started dancing with her and described him as being \u201cflirtatious \u201d with her , according to sentencing court documents . after she began to feel uncomfortable and \u201cturn her body away so that he would not be directly \u2018behind \u2019 her , \u201d he became \u201ctouchy \u201d and put his hands on her waist , stomach and upper thighs .     uig via getty images     the woman said turner \" creeped \" her out because of his persistence , the court document stated .     it is unclear why it took the women so long to report the incident to the police .     turner was previously arrested in 2014 , when a police officer saw him and a group of friends walking and drinking beers on campus . when the officer yelled , \" stop ! police ! \" the group ran away from him and continued running after he yelled it again .     one of the men who was detained identified turner as one of his swim teammates whom he was drinking with when the detective first saw him . the detective then called turner and asked him to return to the scene , and when he did , he was wearing a \" bright orange tuxedo \" and smelled of alcohol , the document said . he had a backpack with beers inside , as well as a beer in his hand , and admitted to trying to hide the beer because he was under age .     the prosecutors ' sentencing document says it was \" abundantly \" clear that on the night of the sexual assault , turner was \" on the prowl \" and attempted to \" hook up \" with women who were strangers to him . the sexual assault came one week after he was similarly aggressive with another female , at a different fraternity party , at the same location , the document said .     the document stated that turner is still in denial about his criminal culpability and that he violated the victim ' s body and her right to choose with whom she engages in sexual activity , the document states . in his statement to probation he seems to regret his choice , not because it caused a woman to be sexually assaulted , but because it has greatly affected his life as though he is the \" victim \" of \" peer pressure , \" the document states .     in the early morning hours of jan. 18 , after brock was arrested , police observed a text message sent to turner in the \u201cgroup me \u201d application that said \u201cwho \u2019 s t*** are those ? \u201d police obtained a search warrant for turner \u2019 s phone but were unable to locate that text or any photos relating to that text , according to the documents .     the search of turner \u2019 s phone \u201cshed some light \u201d into his behavior and character during the time period relating to the sexual assault and in the year prior to when he began attendance at stanford , according to the sentencing document .     prosecutors said there was evidence indicating turner engaged in \u201cexcessive drinking and using drugs , \u201d including a photo of him smoking from a pipe , a close-up photo of a bong , another photo of one of turner \u2019 s swim teammates with a bong in his hand and a december 2014 video showing turner smoking from a bong and drinking out of a bottle of liquor .     several text messages indicative of drug use during turner \u2019 s time at stanford and when he was still in high school in ohio were also found on his phone , according to the sentencing document , and the texts contained several references to smoking , buying and sharing \u201cweed \u201d from as early as april 2014 , as well as references to doing acid or trying to find a \u201chook up. \u201d     the document also stated that turner lied about ever using illicit drugs in his statement to probation and appeared to make it seem as though his first time drinking was at a swim party when he first got to stanford . prosecutors also said he also lied about that there was some sort of \u201cflirtation \u201d between the woman he kissed abruptly at the frat party .     the judge who oversaw turner \u2019 s case has been receiving abusive and threatening phone calls after his six-month sentence caused a media frenzy , said santa clara public defender gary goodman . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> \u201chow does the average person who is really upset and troubled about the brock story , how does somebody participate in that , making right of a wrong ? \u201d mr. stedman said . \u201cwe are really just one tiny , infinitesimal part of that puzzle , but i think it was a no-brainer for us. \u201d     in her letter , ms. rasmussen , 20 , says that there was a distinction between rape and mr. turner \u2019 s case , and suggested that alcohol was to blame for his actions .     mr. turner , 20 , a swimmer at stanford , was found by two passers-by , partially clothed behind a trash bin on campus , on top of the 23-year-old woman , who was incapacitated by alcohol , according to the authorities . the passers-by stopped the assault and held mr. turner down as he tried to flee .     \u201ci don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn \u2019 t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him , \u201d ms. rasmussen , who plays drums in the band , wrote . \u201cbut where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campus isn \u2019 t always because people are rapists. \u201d     mr. turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault for the attack , which took place in january 2015. this week the judge in the case , aaron persky of superior court in santa clara county , calif. , came under withering criticism from the public for the sentence he imposed : six months in jail and probation .     newsletter sign up continue reading the main

rasmussen \u2019 s letter was part of a package of letters sent to the judge on behalf of mr. turner before his sentencing , a standard practice in which people seek to influence a sentencing decision by sharing their experiences of the defendant . his father also sent a letter that had an even more explosive effect when it was made public this week ; he said that the episode had affected his son \u2019 s appetite and that , in particular , he no longer enjoyed rib-eye steaks .     following the firestorm her letter provoked , ms. rasmussen said that her words were being twisted and that she was being unfairly stigmatized . \u201cthis appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests i sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that i blame the victim involved , \u201d she said in a statement .     ms. rasmussen also believed that the letter to the judge was private . but a spokesman for the court said she was wrong \u2014 such letters , like most documents entered into the court , are a matter of public record .     advertisement continue reading the main story     within hours of ms. rasmussen \u2019 s letter being made public by new york magazine , good english was removed from a roster of brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to perform in the coming days , including rock shop in gowanus , industry city distillery in greenwood , gold sounds in bushwick , and bar matchless in greenpoint .     \u201cwe don \u2019 t want to be affiliated with anyone that \u2019 s going to try to victim-blame or even just downplay rape , \u201d said larry hyland , an owner of bar matchless .     mr. hyland said he had received over 50 emails and posts on the bar \u2019 s facebook page demanding that the band \u2019 s show be canceled . some of the messages , he said , included threats to confront the band members if they did perform .     \u201cwe didn \u2019 t cancel the show because of censorship , \u201d he said , adding that while he disagreed with the content of ms. rasmussen \u2019 s letter , he understood the impulse to want to help a childhood friend . \u201ci wanted to avoid an unsafe environment. \u201d     on tuesday , the dayton music art and film festival near the band \u2019 s hometown announced that it , too , was removing the band from its september lineup . \u201csuch actions should not be defended , friend or not , \u201d the festival wrote on its facebook page . on wednesday , behind the curtains media , the public relations firm that represented good english , dropped them from its client roster .     in her statement , ms. rasmussen attributed the fallout from her initial letter not to what she wrote , but to \u201cthe

i assume that this tease is related to the upcoming vmas , and that taylor is contractually obligated to promote her single release \u2013 katy perry peace summit ( it \u2019 s happening , they both need the ratings ) throughout the week . but there is no reason that can \u2019 t wait until tuesday , when the press cycle is free and clear of eye-burning memes and game of thrones complaints . this is my problem with late-period taylor \u2014 not the whining , which has always been part of her brand , but how incompetent the dissemination of said whining is . get your messaging together . it \u2019 s 2017.     michael baumann :     andrew gruttadaro : in ancient greece \u2014 likely around 585 b.c. \u2014 a solar eclipse occurred during a battle between the medes and the lydians , inspiring the factions to put down their weapons and declare peace . in the united states of america \u2014 in the year 2017 a.d. \u2014 musician taylor swift saw that a solar eclipse was coming and picked up her weapons and aimed them at the famed tribe of the kardashians . people interpret omens differently . [ shrugs. ]     kate knibbs : remember when people kept leaving snake emoji on taylor swift ' s ( now-deleted ) instagram posts ? i barely do , because last summer feels like it happened 5,000 years ago and on a different planet , so to refresh : taylor swift bashed kanye west ' s lyrics about her in \" famous . \" kim kardashian west then posted a video on snapchat showing kanye on the phone with taylor , who seemed to approve of the song . and thus taylor was branded a snake , a disingenuous conniver .     and now , after a low-profile 2017 , swift has deleted all her social media posts and uploaded a single , undulating reptile tail . it probably means that she ' s going to release new music , but i also hope it means that she ' s going to release new music and she ' s decided to set aside her gee-golly wallflower ingenue persona for good and embrace a public image that more accurately reflects her personality . swift ' s a slytherin . she muscled her way into songwriting fame by masterminding insanely catchy songs that simultaneously trashed the reputations of men who had wronged her . she got caught either flat-out lying or at least exaggerating for sympathy . look what she did to tom hiddleston .     secretly bad taylor was no fun . it ' s time for openly bad taylor . more feuds , more drama , absolutely no more hangouts with blake lively and ryan reynolds . instead of denying her snake side , i hope this weird video of a snake \u2019 s butt means that taylor swift has decided to lean into her true trickster nature .     jordan coley : those close to me have probably heard me saying this privately for months , but after taylor swift \u2019 s cryptic instagram post monday morning , i figured it was time i brought this theory forward . prior to monday morning \u2019 s post , swift had not really posted anything on her instagram in many months . she was noticeably absent during the election and was nowhere to be found at the grammys this past february . this is , of course , because taylor swift is trapped in the upside down . yes , the dark , lifeless parallel reality that netflix \u2019 s stranger things famously brought to our attention . but didn \u2019 t she make that video for russell westbrook ? nope , we all know the nba is rigged ; that video was recorded before the season even started . but didn \u2019 t she promote lorde and haim \u2019 s new releases on instagram ? pfft \u2014 automated pr content from her label . listen , taylor \u2019 s trapped down there , and whatever \u2019 s down there with her doesn \u2019 t look too friendly . monday morning \u2019 s post was a cry for help . now , we can either sit around and do nothing , or get off our butts and go buy some christmas lights .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> about     \" taylor swift is a snake \" is a catchphrase used to smear the american pop singer-songwriter as a deceitful manipulator in the light of her post-breakup dispute with calvin harris , scottish musician and her ex-boyfriend , as well as an unrelated controversy stemming from her reaction to the lyrics of kanye west ' s 2016 rap single \" famous \" , both of which became high publicized in july 2016. the phrase is mainly used in the form of emoji and comment spamming on her instagram account .     origin     the rocky relationship between taylor swift and kanye west began with the latter ' s infamous interruption of swift \u2019 s acceptance speech at the 2009 mtv video music awards . a few years later , the two musicians seemed to have reconciled their differences at the 2015 mtv video music awards , with taylor swift confirming that there were no hard feelings between them in an interview with mtv , while kanye west publicly apologized for his previous stunt during his acceptance speech for the michael jackson video vanguard award . then in late june 2016 , another feud arose between the two following the release of the music video for \" famous , \" the first single from kanye west ' s seventh studio album the life of pablo .             the music video quickly became a popular subject of gossips and media attention due to its inclusion of provocative imageries of celebrities and public figures , as well as lyrical references alluding to his     i feel like me and taylor might still have sex     why ?

stopping its military assaults on syrian towns , withdrawing heavy weapons , returning troops to barracks and talking with the opposition on a \" political transition . \"     the second option would involve the council taking action to pressure damascus to fully comply with the annan plan , she said .     neither of those scenarios appear likely because damascus has shown no interest in living up to its commitments and russia has made clear that any security council moves to step up the pressure on assad ' s government through sanctions are out of the question .     \" in the absence of either of those two scenarios there seems to be only one other alternative , and that is indeed the worst case , \" rice said , adding that it was unfortunately looking like \" the most probable . \"     \" that is that the violence escalates , the conflict spreads and intensifies , \" she said . \" it involves countries in the region , it takes on increasingly sectarian forms , and we have a major crisis not only in syria but in the region . \"     in such a case , rice said , the annan plan would be dead and the syrian violence would become \" a proxy conflict with arms flowing in from all sides . \"     \" and members of this council and members of the international community are left with the option only of having to consider whether they ' re prepared to take actions outside of the annan plan and the authority of this council , \" she said .     she did not specify what kind of \" actions \" she meant . the united states has led past military interventions that were not authorized by the security council , namely in kosovo and iraq . so far the united states and its western allies have rejected military options and said they would not arm the rebels .     russia defends arms sales to syria     german ambassador peter wittig said council members expressed revulsion at the massacre at houla last week , where more than 100 people , including many children were killed , probably by syrian government forces and militia .     wittig urged the council to consider a resolution that would sanction \" spoilers \" of the annan plan and suggested that it think about whether the mission of unarmed observers should be expanded .     the british and french envoys also spoke of the need to intensify pressure on assad ' s government .     but russian ambassador vitaly churkin said moscow , which holds a veto on the security council , opposes the idea of ratcheting up pressure on damascus in the form of u.n. sanctions .     \" our attitude toward sanctions , frankly , continues to be negative , \" he said , adding that moscow wants countries doing so to stop supplying weapons to syrian rebels . he also voiced concern about the increasing presence of extremists in syria .     asked about russia ' s supply of weapons to assad ' s government , churkin said : \" the weapons we may have provided to syria under various contracts , which were concluded a long time ago , are fully in line with international law and do not contribute to the current armed violence in syria . \"     the expulsion of syrian diplomats from several countries , including the united states , could be mistaken as a precursor to foreign military intervention in syria , churkin said .     \" i hope an effort is made not to allow this step to be misinterpreted as something which is basically a prerequisite of some kind of a foreign military intervention in the near future , which is not the case . \"     syrian ambassador bashar ja ' afari complained about unilateral u.s. , european and other sanctions , calling them \" irresponsible acts . \"     speaking to reporters in geneva , guehenno said that \" in the council there is an understanding that any sliding toward a full-scale civil war in syria would be catastrophic and the security council now needs to have that kind of strategic discussion on how that needs to be avoided . \"     he did not say what kinds of steps the council should take . earlier he told the council via video link that the violence is unlikely to stop without political negotiations between the government and opposition , u.n. diplomats said .

        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~>president donald trump , accompanied by his daughter ivanka , waves as they walk to board marine one on the south lawn of the white house in washington , wednesday , feb. 1 , 2017 . ( ap photo/evan vucci ) ( associated press )     dover air force base , del . ( ap ) \u2014 assuming the somber duties of commander in chief , president donald trump made an unannounced trip wednesday to honor the returning remains of a u.s. navy seal killed in a weekend raid in yemen .     chief special warfare operator william \" ryan \" owens , a 36-year-old from peoria , illinois , was the first known u.s. combat casualty since trump took office less than two weeks ago . more than half a dozen militant suspects were also killed in the raid on an al-qaida compound and three other u.s. service members were wounded .     more than a dozen civilians were also killed in the operation , including the 8-year-old daughter of anwar al-awlaki , a radical cleric and u.s. citizen who was targeted and killed by a drone strike in 2011.     trump ' s trip to delaware ' s dover air base was shrouded in secrecy . the president and his daughter , ivanka , departed the white house in the presidential helicopter with their destination unannounced . a small group of journalists traveled with trump on the condition that the visit was not reported until his arrival .     after returning to the white house , trump commented on the trip at the swearing-in of rex tillerson as secretary of state .     \" i just returned from an amazing visit with a great , great family at dover , \" trump said . \" it is something very sad , very beautiful . ryan , a great man . \"     marine one landed at dover shortly before a c-17 believed to be carrying owens ' remains touched down . the president met with owens ' family during a two-hour visit to the base . the sailor ' s family had requested that trump ' s visit and the return of owens ' remains be private .     former president barack obama lifted a ban on media coverage of the casualty returns , though families may still request privacy . a spokeswoman at dover said about half of families choose to allow media coverage .     owens joined the navy in 1998 and was the recipient of two bronze stars , a joint service commendation and an afghanistan campaign medal , among other honors . in a statement following his death , the navy special command called owens a \" devoted father , a true professional and a wonderful husband . \"     his death underscores the human costs of the military campaigns trump now oversees . far fewer troops are serving in combat now than in the wars trump ' s predecessors led in afghanistan and iraq , but thousands of americans remain in hotspots around the world .     in afghanistan , where america ' s longest war continues , about 8,400 u.s. troops are training and advising local forces . more than u.s. 5,100 troops in iraq and about 500 in syria are involved in the campaign against the islamic state group . the u.s. also engages in counterterrorism operations \u2014 mainly drone strikes \u2014 in yemen , where al-qaida in the arabian peninsula has exploited the chaos of the country ' s civil war .     sunday ' s pre-dawn raid \u2014 which a defense official said was planned by the obama administration but authorized by trump \u2014 could signal a new escalation against extremist groups in yemen .     as a candidate , trump said he would be willing to \" take out \" the families of terrorists in order to root out extremism . on tuesday , white house spokesman sean spicer said no americans \" will ever be targeted \" in raids against terror suspects .     the president ' s trip to dover comes as he begins weighing whether to reshape u.s. military activities around the world . as a candidate , he vowed to be tougher on the islamic state and at one point said he would be willing to send up to 30,000 u.s. troops to fight the extremist group in iraq and syria . last week , trump gave the pentagon and other agencies 30 days to submit a plan for defeating the islamic state .     trump has said little about his approach to afghanistan . obama had pledged to end the war there on his watch , but continuing security concerns prompted him to extend the u.s. military campaign , handing the war off to a third american president .     trump , who never served in the armed forces and received student and medical deferments during the vietnam war , had an uneven relationship with the military community during the presidential campaign .     about 60 percent of voters who served in the military supported trump in the presidential election , compared with 34 percent who voted for democrat hillary clinton , according to exit polls . but trump was also criticized by military groups , including the veterans of foreign wars , for his feud with the khan family , whose muslim-american son was killed while serving in iraq .     ___     associated press writer lolita c. baldor and ap polling director emily swanson

d.c. in the meantime , \" stephanie winston wolkoff , senior adviser to the first lady told abc news . \" mrs. trump is honored to serve this country and is taking the role and responsibilities of the first lady very seriously . \"     the confirmation comes after a rumor sparked by tabloids early wednesday morning that the first lady and her 10-year-old son barron trump were not considering a move to washington , d.c. from new york city .     later on wednesday , the white house also announced that lindsay reynolds would be joining the first lady \u2019 s team as her chief of staff .     \" i am putting together a professional and highly-experienced team which will take time to do properly , \u201d the first lady said in a white house press release .     apart from being the first lady \u2019 s chief of staff , reynolds is also an assistant to the president . but in her capacity as chief of staff , reynolds will be in charge of \" managing the agenda and day to day operations \" of the first lady \u2019 s office .     \" it has been an honor to take on the responsibility of the position of first lady , with its long history as an important representative of the president , our family , and the traditions of our nation around the world , \" the first lady said in the statement . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> melania trump has hired a chief of staff , a move that puts her first official mark on the white house , but the first lady \u2019 s office is likely to be pretty lonely for the foreseeable future .     trump herself hasn \u2019 t been in washington since her husband \u2019 s inauguration weekend , and it \u2019 s not clear when she will return . she has said she plans to continue living in trump tower in manhattan while son barron finishes out the school year .     story continued below     and even though lindsay reynolds , a private fundraising planner and former official in president george w. bush \u2019 s visitors office , will be joining the second floor of the east wing , there \u2019 s little insight on when she \u2019 ll get co-workers .     key roles still open in the first lady \u2019 s office include the press operation , scheduling , correspondence and the social office .     the relatively empty first lady \u2019 s office is a break from melania trump \u2019 s predecessors . laura bush and michelle obama each assumed the role with a chief of staff and a social secretary at the ready .     but some say it \u2019 s not surprising that melania trump hasn \u2019 t staked her claim on the office of the first lady , since she has yet to settle into the white house . the first lady \u2019 s role comes with a budget and a staff that technically reports to the office of the president , but there \u2019 s no statutory authority and its contours have been shaped by tradition .     \u201cwe have become accustomed with the activism of the first lady , but there \u2019 s nothing that is required and there really is no specific job description for the first lady , \u201d said anita mcbride , former chief of staff to laura bush and an executive in residence at american university . \u201ceach occupant gets to rewrite how they want to handle it. \u201d     reynolds was involved in planning the inauguration under former vogue events planner stephanie winston wolkoff , who is acting as a consultant to the first lady . key roles still open in the first lady \u2019 s office include the press operation , scheduling , correspondence and the social secretary \u2019 s office , which plans state dinners and other formal events .     residence staff had to step in and organize the swearing-in ceremony for white house appointees and the lunch with british prime minister theresa may last week . \u201cthe most important person in the first lady \u2019 s office is the social secretary , \u201d said mcbride . she cautioned that working without a social secretary is not a \u201clong-term solution. \u201d     \u201cclearly you \u2019 re going to have a lot of social events that will require the expertise of a social secretary , \u201d she said .     ebs burnough , former deputy social secretary to michelle obama , said it \u2019 s not necessary to have an active first lady \u2019 s office as long as the social secretary has access to the oval office . \u201cthe social secretary can conceivably not see the first lady and just deal directly with the president , \u201d he said .     transition officials sought guidance from staffers who worked for obama and for laura bush , according to sources , which is customary . since the transition , jessica boulanger , a washington-based communications executive and the founder of a line of maternity wear , has been helping the first lady field press requests pro bono , she said .     obama \u2019 s east wing was largely staffed by inauguration day , and even staff attracted an unusual degree of attention \u2014 including social secretary desiree rogers , who scored a spread in vogue . obama used her role to promote exercise and healthy eating , a campaign that required a staff to manage and execute .     melania trump said during the campaign that she would fight online bullying .     melania trump \u2019 s stepdaughter ivanka joined her father on his trip to dover air force base , where they were present as the remains of a navy seal killed in a weekend raid in yemen were returned to the u.s. it was the first time ivanka trump , who \u2019 s moved with her family to washington and whose husband , jared kushner , is a senior white house adviser , had taken on any of the symbolic duties usually reserved for a president \u2019 s spouse .     ivanka trump was a vocal presence on the campaign trail and was in the west wing last weekend as her father made calls . a source close to her says she doesn \u2019 t have a desk in the east wing \u201cfor now. \u201d     white house aides have said melania trump will move to washington in the summer , once barron , the president \u2019 s youngest child , finishes the school year in new york .     people in melania trump \u2019 s upper east side set haven \u2019 t been surprised to see her take a low-key approach to her new role . \u201cshe ' s sort of like rapunzel in the tower , \u201d said one new york city socialite who knows trump from her infrequent appearances on the new york social and charity scene .     annie karni contributed to this report .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> since donald trump ' s inauguration , melania ( r ) has not been seen at official events and is not living in the white house , raising questions on what kind of first lady the former model will be ( afp photo/nicholas kamm )     new york ( afp ) - two weeks after her husband ' s inauguration , questions are mounting about what kind of first lady melania trump will be .     the 46-year-old former model wowed the crowds at his swearing-in ceremony and inaugural balls dressed in ralph lauren powder blue and a vanilla crepe , ticking fashion boxes and suggesting that the mother of one was anxious to step up to her new role .     since then , however , she has not been seen at official events , is not living in the white house and is still putting together her staff .     she was last spotted by the president ' s side at an inter-faith church service on january 21 before making the reported 90-minute commute home to new york by helicopter , plane and motorcade the following day . with no imminent plans to move to washington , she ' s said to want the couple ' s 10-year-old son barron to stay at his school at least until the end of the academic year .     on tuesday , she was conspicuously absent when trump announced his supreme court pick . vice president mike pence and neil gorsuch brought their wives . even trump ' s sons donald jr. and eric made the journey from new york .     on wednesday , the president ' s daughter ivanka accompanied him to delaware to honor a fallen navy seal . unlike her stepmother , ivanka has already moved from new york with her husband , white house advisor jared kushner .     asked in december if he would be lonely rattling around the white house on his own , then president-elect donald trump told fox news : \" no , i ' ll be working . \"     never in modern times -- when americans are accustomed to having visible and active first ladies -- has a president ' s wife not moved straight to washington .     \" certainly in that time we haven ' t seen a phenomenon such as this where the first lady delays for at least several months moving into the white house , \" said katherine jellison , history professor at ohio university .     for more news videos visit yahoo view , available now on ios and android .     - quiet start common -     melania ' s absence has prompted speculation in the media , which trump ' s senior advisor stephen bannon has likened to \" the opposition \" for its tough , critical coverage of the president ' s campaign and his first two weeks in office .     \" whither melania trump ? \" 12 days without a public sighting , \" cnn said . \" where is melania ? \" asked the washington post . \" separate lives , \" ran a headline in celebrity magazine us weekly .     the white house announced wednesday that the first lady had appointed a chief of staff -- lindsay reynolds , who previously served there under george w. bush .     \" i am putting together a professional and highly experienced team which will take time to do properly , \" the first lady said in the statement .     still , first ladies tend to maintain low profiles at the start . hillary clinton and rosalynn carter proved exceptions to the rule .     \" the first lady often sets out her policy agenda in march or april , complementing and reinforcing the 100-days agenda of the president , \" said connecticut college government professor maryann borrelli .     but beyond admiring michelle obama and jacqueline kennedy and mentioning a potential campaign against cyber bullying , melania has given little indication so far of what kind of first lady she wants to be .     - reframing the job ? -     since trump assumed office , her official facebook and twitter accounts have issued just one update -- on january 21 -- proclaiming her \" deeply honored \" to serve .     just one appointment to her staff has been revealed besides reynolds : longtime friend and new york event planner stephanie winston wolkoff as senior adviser . other positions such as press and social secretaries have yet to be filled .     the absence is not helping her lackluster approval ratings , partly a by-product of her husband ' s deep unpopularity among half the electorate . she was also mocked during the campaign for a major speech that plagiarized michelle obama .     but borelli believes her unpopularity is not entirely unusual .     \" i think that first ladies often enter the white house with a mix of support and suspicion and then the job is -- because they do public outreach -- how to capitalize on the support and manage suspicion , \" she said .     michelle obama , the first african-american first lady , and clinton and eleanor roosevelt , who both defied the meek housewife stereotype , also came in for heavy criticism particularly at the start .     others say it is time for an independent first lady who reflects reality in the 21st century , when few american women are defined by their husbands .     should melania continue to keep a low profile , future generations may credit her as a modernizer who broke free from the confines of her position .     \" it may lower expectations for the next woman , \"

at 3 p.m. et .     out in the nevada desert today , the world got a good look at the first public test of the hyperloop \u2014 a concept that could someday become a new mode of transportation .     don ' t call it a wright brothers ' \" kitty hawk \" moment just yet , though . the demo focused on only one piece of a very complicated system .     the hyperloop , envisioned by tesla and spacex founder elon musk , would move passenger-filled pods through special tubes at incredibly high speeds \u2014 as in possibly crossing the 400 miles between san francisco and los angeles in a mere 30 minutes . musk offered up his ideas in 2013 , and others got to work trying to build it .     one of the startups that jumped at the challenge is hyperloop one , formerly hyperloop technologies , tested its propulsion mechanism today . take a look , via cnbc :     the wall street journal wrote earlier in the day :     \" the focus of the test will be more on the propulsion technology \u2014 whether it can actually move the sled \u2014 than the speed . the track is shorter and there will be air resistance , two slowing factors which will be eliminated in future tests . \"     on tuesday , hyperloop one announced new funding and new partners in transportation and engineering . one of those partners is danish architect bjarke ingels . gizmodo says that ingels , known for big public infrastructure projects , \" will give some much-needed design direction for how hyperloop one ' s projects might start to integrate with the cities they ' re meant to serve . \" gizmodo also has this statement from the architect :     \" with hyperloop we are not only designing a futuristic station or a very fast train , we are dealing with an entirely novel technology with the potential to completely transform how our existing cities will grow and evolve , and how new cities will be conceived and constructed . \"     hyperloop one ceo rob lloyd said in a statement that the company would work with these new partners \" to redefine the future of transportation , providing a more immediate , safe , efficient and sustainable high-speed backbone for the movement of people and things . \"     toggle caption joshua caldwell of cryptic butterfly photography/hyperloop one     so will any of this actually work ? npr ' s elise hu asked the question when musk announced his idea almost three years ago . electrical engineer marc thompson told her it seemed that it would . but that ' s not the end of the story , said the worcester polytechnic professor : \" the devil ' s in the details in terms of testing , safety , passenger safety , egress , vibration , all that engineering stuff . \"     former u.s. department of transportation assistant secretary emil frankel also had reservations , which he shared with elise at the time .     \" to talk about these kinds of leapfrogging technology in a context when we can ' t really adequately maintain our existing infrastructure is really not terribly realistic . at least not in terms of the public policy debate , \" frankel said .     hyperloop one and competitor hyperloop transportation technologies , or htt , don ' t seem deterred . htt is making progress , too , wired notes :     \" we think we will be able to demonstrate full kitty hawk capabilities by the end of this year . \" \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>

utopian , eco-friendly community planned for central california . and while we \u2019 re rooting for them to succeed with their test track , it still doesn \u2019 t change the hyperloop \u2019 s largest challenges . because the biggest hurdle isn \u2019 t the tech behind hyperloop , it \u2019 s the land rights and every other bureaucratic obstacle that goes along with building enormous infrastructure projects .     back in the summer of 2013 , elon musk announced to the world that he had a revolutionary idea about the future of transportation . he called his concept the hyperloop , and everyone was excited that they \u2019 d soon zip between distant major cities at 600 miles per hour . the tech press quickly picked apart the technical minutia of such a proposal , debating whether musk \u2019 s idea was technologically possible . what so many reporters then and since have continued to ignore is that you can \u2019 t build a mode of transportation between cities like san francisco and los angeles without rights to the land in between them . not to mention the other challenges things like environmental impact reports or liability considerations .     \u201cafter over two and a half years of research and development our team has reached another important milestone . this will be the world \u2019 s first passenger-ready hyperloop system , \u201d dirk ahlborn , the ceo of hyperloop transportation technologies , said in a statement released to the verge about the plans for quay valley . \u201ceveryone traveling on california \u2019 s i-5 in 2016 will be able to see our activities from the freeway. \u201d     with every puff piece that \u2019 s published about companies like hyperloop transportation technologies ( not to be confused with competing company hyperloop technologies ) , everyone seems focused on the tech , rather than the real challenge : land rights and bureaucracy . assuming their permit is approved for quay valley , the idea of building a hyperloop track between two distant cities remains a techno-utopian fantasy arguably as misguided as quay valley itself .     josh stephens makes this same point in a recent blog post :     and yet , this combination of enthusiasm and magnetism doesn \u2019 t buy farmland . it doesn \u2019 t ease eminent domain takings . it doesn \u2019 t blast through bedrock or relocate utilities . it doesn \u2019 t design station area plans . it doesn \u2019 t write [ environmental impact reports ] or dismiss [ california environmental quality act ] suits . trains , whether propelled by steam , diesel , or a frictionless tube , are still terrestrial things . and what terra we have in california . the very same mountains , cities , canals , farmers , and habitats that complicate [ high speed rail ] also complicate hyperloop . the more the hyperloop people drop hints and make innuendos about zipping this way and that without addressing the monumental public policy challenges that they \u2019 re going to face , governmental cooperation they \u2019 re going to need , and money that it \u2019 s going to cost , the less it \u2019 s going to sound like tesla for the masses and the more it \u2019 s going to sound like a lost chapter of \u201catlas shrugged. \u201d     advertisement     none of this is new . even before the official announcement back in august of 2013 , i wrote a post raising skepticism that you \u2019 d be able to build a hyperloop between san francisco and los angeles without putting it underground or out in the ocean . and even then , you \u2019 d still have to get land rights and work with the government in myriad ways .         so we \u2019 ll wait with earnest optimism as hyperloop transportation technologies to build a working hyperloop prototype in quay valley , a planned community on virgin soil by sometime this year . but until we hear that any hyperloop company has a legal and lobbying team as big as its tech team , we \u2019 re going to remain pretty damn skeptical that this will happen within our lifetime .     advertisement     this post was originally published on january 20 , 2016 .\n\n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> the company developing elon musk ' s 700mph maglev train has announced new details about the levitation system it plans to use .     hyperloop transportation technologies said on monday that it will use a passive magnetic levitation system developed by lawrence livermore national labs in the us .     the los angeles-headquartered transportation company wants to build a system that involves firing a pod full of people through a low-pressure tube at speeds of up to 760 mph . it has been described by inventor musk as a mix between concorde , a rail gun , and an air hockey table that could take you from los angeles to san francisco in under 30 minutes .     hyperloop technologies said that magnetic fields in the tunnel will lift the pod before a \" thrust force \" is applied , accelerating the pod to speeds just shy of the speed of sound ( 767 mph ) .     the same thrust force is simply reversed to decelerate the pod . as the pod slows down , the system ' s battery is recharged through what hyperloop describes as regenerative breaking .     \" utilising a passive levitation system will eliminate the need for power stations along the hyperloop track , which makes this system the most suitable for the application and will keep construction costs low , \" said bibop gresta , coo of hyperloop transportation technologies , in a statement . \" from a safety aspect , the system has huge advantages , levitation occurs purely through movement , therefore if any type of power failure occurs , hyperloop pods would continue to levitate and only after reaching minimal speeds touch the ground . \"     critics have questioned whether hyperloop will ever come to fruition , targeting cost and safety as potential major setbacks . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> a few days ago , an executive with hyperloop transportation technologies \u2014 one of two major companies seeking to turn hyperloop from science fiction to reality \u2014 said the major expense incurred during construction would be \u201cthe tube. \u201d this is absolutely right if he \u2019 s thinking about building hyperloop just as a proof of concept . if he wants to build something functional , that people use , he should prepare to spend the bulk of his company \u2019 s cash on carpeting . the problem with elon musk \u2019 s hyperfast hypertransport \u2014 the one people aren \u2019 t already talking about \u2014 is that riders are going to vomit everywhere .     that \u2019 s hyperbolic of course , but the fact remains that the way hyperloop is being pitched to the public right now \u2014 a 750 mile-per-hour pneumatically-run speed tube designed to get tesla owners from san francisco to los angeles in 35 minutes \u2014 doesn \u2019 t touch on human physiology and creature comfort . when people are commuting to and from work , trekking across town to take care of errands , or traveling long distances , they want to do so without feeling profoundly uncomfortable . speed is great , but there \u2019 s a reason people will forgo a crowded subway for ungodly traffic if it means they can at least enjoy some space in their car .     in a vacuum , humans can handle a constant speed , whether it \u2019 s at a snail \u2019 s pace or a bullet \u2019 s screech . but a real hyperloop won \u2019 t just travel several hundred miles and then reverse course in the opposite direction . there will be stops , a lot of them if this kind of technology emerges as the successor to our aging railroad system . that means pods will be speeding up and slowing down more frequently than most of us would want . and the united states is not flat \u2014 it \u2019 s got a pretty gnarly terrain in some places . hyperloop will be forced to go around these things , and above them in some instances .     currently , high-speed trains ( all the rage in asian countries like china and japan ) top off at around 200 miles per hour or so . moving at this high rate of speed consistently produces few physical symptoms , but acceleration , deceleration , and turns get problematic after a certain point . the human body can only handle about 0.2 gs of acceleration vertically or laterally . hyperloop would involve accelerations that would potentially push way past this limit ( up to seven times greater than the limits imposed on japan \u2019 s shinkansen bullet train ) .     when you move , g-forces act on your body , in both positive ways ( e.g . pushing you back to your seat ) and negative ways ( e.g . pulling you forward into your seatbelt ) . when you throw in the ability to move in three different planes , you \u2019 re contending with g-forces in three different directions . your gastrointestinal tract can lurch in a different direction than your spinal column . that \u2019 s when nausea sets in \u2014 and if the ride doesn \u2019 t end soon or if you don \u2019 t find a way to adjust , prepare to say hello again to your latest meal .     the solution , naturally , is to go slower . the hyperloop pod competition sponsored by elon musk and spacex requires teams to construct pods that go at least 240 miles per hour . naturally , teams like mit are building prototypes capable of moving considerably faster . as hyperloop moves forward , however , the 240 mph range might actually be standard outside of the great plains . if too fast is too uncomfortable , the hyperloop will slow down .     it \u2019 s important to emphasize that human physiology is relative \u2014 what causes one person to wretch is someone else \u2019 s cup of tea . some people can handle a bumpy ride better than others . the problem with the hyperloop \u2014 in its most ideal form \u2014 is that any turns it makes will make everyone uncomfortable . as a technology , the hyperloop is one of the most intriguing projects under development right now . but we should approach it with a healthy sense of skepticism before we start to see how actual human passengers react to getting shipped around nine-tenths the speed of sound . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> close competing teams will be showing off their hyperloop prototypes in a bid to see who can

( photo : spacex )     san francisco \u2013 the hyperloop wars are on .     on monday , a crowdsourced enterprise led by nasa and boeing veterans called hyperloop transportation technologies announced it had licensed passive magnetic levitation technology to power its prototype system , which like other hyperloop templates , promises to shuttle humans and goods in a vacuum tube system at speeds up to 750 mph .     how fast is that ? zipping from los angeles to san francisco would take 30 minutes as compared to a six-hour drive or an all-day train ride .     hyperloop technologies , one of a number of outfits pursuing hyperloop tech , plans to show off its prototype in the desert north of las vegas this week . ( photo : hyperloop technologies )     the announcement comes just two days before rival hyperloop technologies inc. plans to showcase the evolution of its technology to investors and media in the desert north of las vegas . on its website , hyperloop technologies features photos and videos showing off large tubes that would house long pods for either people or cargo . both hti and htt are based in los angeles .     another player in the space is skytran , located at nasa research park just south of san francisco . the company recently unveiled a technology demonstration system showcasing how its two- and four-person vehicles will work , and are aiming to build a 30-mile track in lagos , nigeria . skytran has raised $ 30 million and is operating in partnership with nasa .     hyperloop technology offers the possibility of moving people and things at great speeds without using fossil fuels . the pitfalls include making such transportation reliable while mitigating for potential catastrophes unfolding at around the speed of sound .     and hyperloop remains more buck rogers than your next shuttle to work .     the foundations of its tech are familiar : the maglev , or magnetic levitation , principle that allows a vehicle to achieve great speeds by riding on air is already at work on high-speed trains in europe and japan . but hyperloop would face the same infrastructure and regulatory hurdles that vex high-speed rail projects and autonomous cars .     and that ' s not to mention the price tag . a tube system linking l.a. and san francisco with hyperloop pods has been estimated to cost north of $ 6 billion .     it ' s on ! we ' re 1 day away from some big announcements . live-tweeting starts tomorrow @ 5pm pdt https://t.co/tassqqwmyy#hyperloop \u2014 hyperlooptech ( @hyperlooptech ) may 9 , 2016     in its monday statement , hyperloop transportation technologies says its design will tackle the safety concerns with a passive levitation system , which will eliminate the need for power stations along the hyperloop track and keep construction costs low .     \" from a safety aspect , the system has huge advantages , levitation occurs purely through movement , therefore if any type of power failure occurs , hyperloop pods would continue to levitate and only after reaching minimal speeds touch the ground , \" said bibop gresta , chief operating officer of hyperloop transportation technologies , said .     also in the hyperloop race is spacex , the rocket company founded by tesla ceo elon musk , who first popularized the idea of shuttling people and cargo in tubes in 2013.     in january , a team from mit won an inaugural hyperloop competition sponsored by spacex . similar to htt ' s approach , the mit team proposed placing magnets on the pods that react to passive coils in the tubes , thereby generating lift or levitation .     hyperloop transportation technologies has announced that is licensing tech that would allow high-speed transportation at lower than anticipated costs when compared to existing magnetic transportation tech .

        ">>QUESTION<<<~start_set_marker~><~start_element_marker~> daniel ramirez medina , 23 , who has no criminal record , was arrested along with his father despite having received protection under obama \u2019 s daca program     us authorities have arrested an immigrant from mexico who was brought to the united states illegally as a child and later given a work permit during the obama administration in what could be the first detention of its kind under donald trump .     daniel ramirez medina , a 23-year-old with no criminal record , was taken into custody last week at his father \u2019 s home in seattle by us immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) officers . the officers arrived at the home to arrest the man \u2019 s father , though court documents did not make clear the reason the father was taken into custody .     immigrant rights groups brace for more deportation raids : ' this is the beginning ' read more     ramirez , now in custody in tacoma , washington , was granted temporary permission to live and work legally in the united states under a program called the deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , established in 2012 by barack obama , according to a court filing .     the program protects from deportation 750,000 people who were brought to the united states illegally as children , sometimes called \u201cdreamers \u201d , and gives them the temporary right to work legally in the united states .     trump has promised a crackdown on the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states , most of whom come from mexico and other latin american countries . a move against daca recipients like ramirez would represent a significant broadening of immigration enforcement under trump .     ramirez filed a challenge to his detention in seattle federal court on monday , arguing that the government violated his constitutional rights because he had work authorization under the daca program .     ethan dettmer , a partner in the law firm gibson dunn &amp; crutcher who is one of the lawyers representing ramirez , said he was not aware of any other daca recipient who had been arrested .     \u201cwe are hoping this detention was a mistake , \u201d dettmer said .     another one of his lawyers , mark rosenbaum of the legal advocacy group public counsel , characterized the daca program as a promise from the federal government \u2019 s executive branch that daca recipients would not be targeted for deportation .         \u201cwe have no reason to believe that promise will be broken . this case should not see the inside of a courtroom , \u201d rosenbaum said .     ramirez was in custody and unavailable for comment . representatives for ice declined immediate comment on the lawsuit .     emily langley , a spokeswoman for the us attorney \u2019 s office in seattle , said the justice department was still reviewing the case .     us immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally . the department of homeland security secretary , john kelly , said the operations , conducted in at least a dozen states , were routine and consistent with regular operations . but immigrant advocacy groups and democrats have expressed concern that the trump administration will escalate immigration enforcement efforts in line with the president \u2019 s tough stance toward undocumented immigrants .     trump campaigned on a promise to roll back obama \u2019 s executive actions on immigration , but since assuming office he has kept his public comments on daca vague .     how immigration activists mobilized to thwart deportation raids last weekend read more     in an interview with abc news last month , trump said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with people covered by daca . \u201cthey are here illegally . they shouldn \u2019 t be very worried . i do have a big heart . we \u2019 re going to take care of everybody . we \u2019 re going to have a very strong border , \u201d trump said at the time .     under daca , the government collected information including participants \u2019 addresses that potentially could be used to locate and deport them if the program is reversed .     ramirez was brought to the united states from mexico in about 2001 when he was about seven , according to the lawsuit . the government granted him a daca card in 2014 and renewed it in 2016 , finding that he was no threat to public safety . he has a three-year-old son , according to the complaint .     ramirez in his lawsuit is seeking his immediate release and an injunction forbidding the government from arresting him again . a hearing in the case has been scheduled for friday . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~>after a week of raids that targeted nearly 700 immigrants across the country , immigrations and customs enforcement has reportedly gone into uncharted territory \u2014 arresting a mexican immigrant who had been cleared to live and work in the u.s. under president obama \u2019 s deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca .     daniel ramirez medina was taken into custody in seattle , wa , last week , reuters reported , after ice officials came to arrest his father ( why ice officers had come for his father remains unclear ) . a 23-year-old with no criminal history , ramirez had been granted a permit to live and work legally in the u.s. under daca , which specifically protects children who were brought to the u.s. by their undocumented parents . these young people , also known as dreamers , named after the proposed dream act .     if ramirez \u2019 s detention was intentional , he would be the first daca recipient arrested under the trump administration , an act that could signal further arrests of immigrants who had been considered , for the moment at least , legal residents of the u.s.     just last month , president donald trump seemed to imply that protections would still apply to immigrants who were granted daca , telling david muir of abc news that people \u201cshouldn \u2019 t be very worried . i do have a big heart . we \u2019 re going to take care of everybody. \u201d     now , ramirez , who is still in custody , has filed a challenge against his detention , arguing that the government violated his constitutional rights by arresting him after he had previously been granted permission to stay in the united states .     in his lawsuit , ramirez claims he had disclosed his daca paperwork twice to ice officers , once in his father \u2019 s home and a second time while in a processing center .     \u201cit doesn \u2019 t matter , because you weren \u2019 t born in this country , \u201d one of the agents reportedly said .     ice did not immediately respond to a request for comment .     a hearing in the case is scheduled for friday .     this post has been updated throughout . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> ( cnn ) a federal judge in seattle on friday declined to release from detention a 23-year-old immigrant who had been protected from deportation under obama-era rules .     magistrate judge james donohue set a february 24 bond hearing for daniel ramirez medina , thereby extending for a week a case that has roiled pro-immigration groups .     ramirez is originally from mexico and had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , his lawyers said . the program , created by president barack obama ' s executive order in 2012 , is meant to shield qualified individuals from deportation .     ramirez was detained by us immigration officials in washington state last week . immigration and customs enforcement officials said medina had admitted to being a gang member , while his attorneys denied that accusation and said he was not a threat to public safety .     \" there is no basis for detaining our client , \" defense attorney theodore boutrous said in a press conference after the hearing . \" it is outrageous . \"     the case raises questions about what it could mean for dreamers , undocumented immigrants who were brought to the united states as children . ramirez came to the united states when he was 7 years old and became a daca recipient in 2014 and renewed in 2016 , according to court papers filed by his attorneys .     immigration rights groups say they believe this may be the first time a dreamer has been arrested without cause .     ramirez ' s lawyers have filed suit in federal court saying their client is being unlawfully held by us immigration and customs enforcement officials .     \" the federal government may not arbitrarily or capriciously deprive daca recipients of these benefits , as they have here with mr. ramirez , \" his lawyers wrote in briefs filed in court .     differing accounts of ramirez ' s history     the government and ramirez ' s lawyers have presented very different depictions of him .     his attorneys argue ramirez is being \" presently detained without justification \" and that he presents \" no threat to national security or public safety . \"     an ice spokesperson offered a different account .     ice said ramirez was taken into custody \" based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety . \"     rose richeson , an ice spokesperson , said , \" mr. ramirez -- a self-admitted gang member -- was encountered at a residence in des moines , washington , during an operation targeting a prior-deported felon . he was arrested february 10 by us immigration and customs enforcement and transferred to the northwest detention center to await the outcome of removal proceedings before an immigration judge with the department of justice ' s executive office for immigration review . \"     mark rosenbaum , counsel for ramirez , disputed the ice ' s characterization in a statement : \" mr. ramirez unequivocally denies being in a gang . while in custody , he was repeatedly pressured by us immigration and customs enforcement agents to falsely admit affiliation . the statement issued tonight by ms. richeson of us immigration and customs enforcement is inaccurate . \"     the conflicting stories come amid immigrant rights attorneys ' fears that president donald trump ' s administration will target the dreamers , who were temporarily allowed to live and work in the united states after passing background checks . about 750,000 people have received permission to stay under daca .     the arrest     ice agents arrived last friday morning at ramirez ' s father ' s house , according to the court papers filed by ramirez ' s attorney . the agents had an arrest warrant for the father . the court papers allege that ice officials asked whether ramirez was in the state legally and he responded that he was .     on the advice of his brother , who also is a daca recipient , ramirez declined to answer more questions .     ice agents took ramirez to a seattle processing center where he told them that he had a work permit . ramirez was told by one of the ice agents , \" it doesn ' t matter , because you weren ' t born in this country , \" according to the lawsuit .     ramirez remains in ice ' s custody in tacoma , according to court documents filed by his lawyers .     ramirez had moved from california to washington in may . he moved with his 3-year-old son to join his father in search of better economic opportunities , according to his lawyers .     ice said that ramirez was arrested in des moines , washington , a suburb south of seattle . his lawyers ' court filing states the arrest happened in seattle .     in response to the case , seattle ' s mayor ed murray and city councilmember m. lorena

illegally into the united states as a child but given a work permit under the obama administration .     the petition challenges the immigration detention and seeks the release of daniel ramirez medina , who his attorneys say was detained by immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) agents friday . the agents were conducting an action at his father \u2019 s house and medina was detained ,

ice , considered him to be \u201clawfully present and is legally authorized to work in the united states , \u201d a status that would usually preclude a serious criminal history .     medina \u2019 s

medina and whether the administration has changed its stance on the daca recipients .     in the meantime , they reiterated that \u201cno city of seattle official will ever ask about your immigration status \u201d and police will not help ice detain or deport immigrants \u201cwho are doing nothing more than raising their families \u201d and contributing to the city \u2019 s success .     but murray warned that \u201cice officials still have the power and jurisdiction to enter into the boundaries of seattle and conduct their harmful actions without notifying the city , \u201d and urged immigrants to review their rights on a facebook workshop .     the lawsuit prompted a quick response by the court . u.s. magistrate judge james donohue in seattle late tuesday issued an order requiring the government to respond to the petition by thursday and set a hearing for friday .     the judge ordered the government to reveal whether medina is still detained and why , \u201cgiven that he has been granted deferred action under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program ? \u201d     the judge is demanding immigration officials say whether he has been placed in \u201cremoval proceedings \u201d to deport him as the result of ice \u2019 s initial custody determination . if not , he asks the government to explain why he is still being held . donohue also asks whether medina has asked for or received a bond hearing .     the lawsuit alleges the government has violated medina \u2019 s due-process rights , according to a joint news release by the public counsel law center , the barrera legal group and the firm of gibson gunn &amp; crutcher , a firm with offices in los angeles .     it seeks his immediate release and an order barring ice from any further actions .     the detention comes on the heels of controversial ice immigration raids following the election of president trump and his promise to deport illegal and criminal immigrants .     daca was created by obama and provided a reprieve from deportation for those who qualify along with renewable work permits . the lawsuit alleges medina twice had his permit renewed before his detention . it \u2019 s estimated that as many as 750,000 young people \u2014 called dreamers \u2014 have taken advantage of the program . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300

( associated press )     los angeles ( ap ) \u2014 a woman who owns a business that claims to be california ' s largest landlord of marijuana businesses sued the city of san bernardino to overturn its pot regulation ordinance that could bar her from the industry .     stephanie smith , the owner of a business called bubba likes tortillas , said in the lawsuit filed friday in san bernardino county superior court that the city ' s new law could create monopolies and also prevent her from renting property to pot growers and other marijuana operations .     the dispute dates back to december when a fortified building smith owns was raided , cultivation operations her clients were operating were shut down and 35,000 marijuana plants were seized . smith was not involved with pot growing and she was not arrested or charged , her attorney ben eilenberg said .     after the raids , a judge invalidated a voter-approved measure to regulate marijuana operations and san bernardino city council passed its own measure to replace it earlier this month .     the new rules said anyone \u2014 from a permit applicant or an employee of a cannabis business to the owner of a property \u2014 could be barred from the commercial cannabis business in the city if they had violated local or state laws related to the industry or if they had failed to report income from it .     smith is concerned that could apply to tenants \u2014 or even her company \u2014 because the businesses raided in december were in the process of being licensed , eilenberg said . they received approval letters to operate a week after they were shut down , but the law appears to make them ineligible to get licenses .     \" this misguided ordinance is a backdoor ban that continues the city ' s illogical campaign against a legal product , \" smith said in a statement . \" any person who has ever had anything to do with cannabis is banned for life from entering the legal market under this ordinance . it is not what the voters want and it makes no sense . \"     eilenberg said it could also apply to businesses that operated in the murky days when medical marijuana was loosely regulated . cities like los angeles and san francisco have given priority to license businesses that operated under medical marijuana regulations to get into the broader retail market that opened jan. 1.     \" san bernardino is taking the opposite tack and guaranteeing that anyone in the city who operated prior to this law has to remain in the black market , \" eilenberg said .     the lawsuit said the ordinance would violate the constitutional right to due process by disqualifying tenants or smith without ever granting them an administrative or criminal hearing .     the lawsuit also claimed the city law could create monopolies of certain types of marijuana operating licenses .     the ordinance would allow 17 commercial marijuana businesses in the city , but there are 19 different types of licenses that could be issued \u2014 everything from growing pot , to transporting it , testing it and selling it .     a city spokeswoman did not immediately comment on the case . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> pacific palisades ( cbsla ) \u2014 stephanie smith , who describes herself as a real estate developer educated at boston college and ucla , made news in december , when police accused her of running a multimillion-dollar marijuana grow operation in san bernardino .     the blonde and blue-eyed 43-year old mother of five with a huge smile made headlines around the world after san bernardino police raided three buildings she owned and confiscated thousands of marijuana plants all seen on video . investigators got suspicious when a $ 67,000 electric bill popped up at one of her properties thought to be vacant and red-tagged it .     smith lives 80 miles from san bernardino in pacific palisades , where police showed up on her doorstep .     smith posted security camera photos online from that day and wrote , \u201craiding a woman and toddlers with swat in full gear and guns is absurd. \u201d     smith declined an interview but through a statement from her attorney she says she \u2019 s \u201ca well-known and recognized leader in large-scale cannabis real estate development. \u201d     she insists she just owns the buildings saying : \u201cthe tenants in my buildings were compliant with the laws of the state of california and had applied for licenses from the city of san bernardino multiple times . only to have their applications rejected for technical reasons .     \u201cthese raids certainly inconvenienced me , but they devastated my tenants , who are small-business operators , destroyed over 100 local jobs that paid excellent wages , squandered badly needed local tax revenue. \u201d     san bernardino community development director mark persico is in charge of permitting marijuana businesses and says the city is an attractive spot for marijuana businesses . they already have 50 applications in the works because of measure o , which passed in 2016.     \u201cthe measure sets up a permitting process for both the cultivation of marijuana as well as the sales , testing , distribution . \u2026 it sets up a whole permit structure , \u201d said persico ,     police say the operators of the business did not have the proper permits to run a business of this scale . the plants will be destroyed , and the operators could be charged with misdemeanors .     if smith looks or sounds familiar , she was the subject of a story cbs2 ran in 2008.     back then , her last name was darcy and she was accused of performing liposuction on patients in dr. craig alan bittner \u2019 s beverly hills office , even though she didn \u2019 t have a medical degree .     three patients sued smith and bittner , but the cases were dismissed .     you might recall bittner also made headlines for turning fat into biodiesel for his suv . the two now work together in real estate development .     a statement from smith :     as a professional real estate developer with several million square feet of commercial and industrial space throughout california , i provide the infrastructure for all types of industry to operate and prosper , including the cannabis industry . i am a well-known and recognized leader in large-scale cannabis real estate development and i am proud of the state of california \u2019 s position on cannabis .     clearly the mayor of san bernardino and i feel differently about cannabis . i \u2019 m strongly on the side of the majority voters in san bernardino and elsewhere who demand the regulation and taxation of commercial cannabis . the tenants in my buildings were compliant with the laws of the state of california and i had applied for licenses from the city of san bernardino multiple times only to have their applications rejected for technical reasons . in raiding buildings that i own , the mayor of san bernardino opposed the will of the voters , wasted city resources and in the process squandered well over $ 1 million of potential annual city taxes from the businesses of my tenants .     these raids certainly inconvenienced me , but they devastated my tenants who are small business operators , destroyed over one hundred local jobs that paid excellent wages , squandered badly needed local tax revenue and violated the will of the voters of san bernardino .     as for the marijuana investigation , the feds helped san bernardino police with their investigation but say it \u2019 s up to police if they want to move forward with pressing charges . again , smith hasn \u2019 t been arrested . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~start_element_marker~> the cannabis company owned by a pacific palisades woman whose marijuana growing operation was uprooted by san bernardino police late last year is suing the city to overturn a new ordinance addressing commercial cannabis businesses .     the suit \u2013 filed friday by bubba likes tortillas , which owns a lot of property used for cannabis businesses \u2013 says the ordinance violates prop . 64 and other california laws . the san bernardino city council unanimously approved the ordinance march 7.     stephanie smith , owner of bubba likes tortillas , claims the ordinance creates a monopoly for certain cannabis license types and bans \u201cany person who has ever had anything to do with cannabis \u2026 from entering the legal market. \u201d     city attorney gary saenz said by phone monday , march 26 , his office had received the lawsuit earlier in the day and hadn \u2019 t had time to review it and offer a comment .     the ordinance \u2013 one of three passed earlier this month \u2013 says the city can award only 17 cannabis business licenses in this first year ; with 19 different cannabis license types available under california law , certain businesses can hold a monopoly on the marketplace , the suit says .     state law grants cities the authority to limit cannabis businesses as they choose .     additionally , smith claims , the ordinance disqualifies any cannabis-related enterprise previously labeled as non-compliant with city law from holding a commercial license . and a renewal could be denied if a business owner is found to have operated in violation of city or state law .     cities such as los angeles and oakland are going the opposite direction and giving priority in licensing to business owners who \u2019 ve had cannabis-related convictions in the past . such social equity programs have been created to help undo some of the historic harms from the war on drugs .     san bernardino \u2019 s requirements violate due process , the suit says . they do \u201cnot require a conviction , administrative hearing , or any other process other than that the city of san bernardino has determined that the actions occurred. \u201d     \u201cthis misguided ordinance is a backdoor ban that continues the city \u2019 s illogical campaign against a legal product , \u201d smith said in a statement .     smith made headlines late last year when san bernardino police seized nearly 25,000 marijuana plants at three bubba likes tortillas locations as part of an intensive investigation . one of the locations was less than a block from the rear of the police station .     smith \u2019 s home also was raided . she was not arrested , though eight men at the sites were arrested on suspicion of cultivating marijuana . less than a week later , nearly 4.5 tons of marijuana was seized at another warehouse owned by smith .     smith did not have a permit to grow in the city , authorities said .     san bernardino \u2019 s marijuana laws have been murky for a while .     voters in 2016 passed measure o , a ballot measure requiring the city allow marijuana dispensaries in certain areas . three permits were awarded , including one to the flesh showgirls strip club on hospitality lane . measure o \u2019 s validity later was challenged in court , putting those permits in limbo .     smith \u2019 s operations were uprooted dec. 13 and 19. on dec. 20 , city leaders passed a temporary moratorium on certain marijuana activities not covered by measure o. nine days later , a san bernardino county superior court judge tentatively ruled measure o invalid for spot zoning \u2013 that is , singling out parcels of land for uses benefiting their owners at the expense of others in the surrounding area .     under measure o \u2019 s zoning restrictions , judge david cohn wrote , only two locations in city \u2013 one being the flesh club , which is not associated with bubba likes tortillas \u2013 would be allowed to sell marijuana .     captain jack \u2019 s , a dispensary at the flesh club address , opened to the public in january with a city and a state license .     on feb. 1 , the city council extended the temporary moratorium up to 10 months and 15 days . at the end of the month , cohn declared measure o invalid in his final , written decision . an appeal was filed on behalf of the flesh club owner , and saenz said the court ruled monday that dispensaries operating with a measure o permit and a state license can continue operating in the city until at least april 27.     the court at that time is expected to make a determination on the city \u2019 s new commercial cannabis ordinance , saenz said . \u201cthere \u2019 s a lot going on in the cannabis world as far as san bernardino is concerned right now.

operation they believe was bringing in millions of dollars a month .     san bernardino police say eight people were detained wednesday when police and federal agents raided the warehouse that was converted into a multi-level grow house .     investigators first turned their sights on the illegal grow operation about two months ago after receiving complaints from neighbors . they found the once-abandoned warehouse had been outfitted with a 12-foot metal rolling fence , \" fortified doors , \" a large concrete wall around the parking lot and surveillance cameras .     inside the four-story warehouse , police found thousands of plants stacked next to one another under heat lamps on wood tables and an advanced irrigation system . the electric bill for the property was about $ 67,000 per month , police said .     \" in my 26 years , it was the biggest grow that i ' ve ever seen , \" san bernardino police lt. mike madden said . \" there were all different rooms for different processes and hydration , filtration and ventilation . it was pretty extensive . \"     cbs los angeles reports that police are investigating the owner , identified as 43-year-old stephanie smith . she was not arrested or charged with a crime . a telephone number for smith could not be located in public records .     san bernardino police dept./cbs news     police and federal investigators raided two other properties owned by smith and seized 18,000 pounds of marijuana in total . eight people who were working in the warehouse in downtown san bernardino were detained by police , but no charges have been filed in the case , madden said .     california voters have approved the legalization of marijuana , but growers must receive licenses and permits from local governments and the state . recreational pot sales start in california on jan. 1 , joining the long-running medical cannabis industry .     \" marijuana has been legalized , but there are stringent requirements , \" madden said . \" it ' s not that you just get to set up shop where you want to set up . \"     the los angeles city council voted dec. 6 to license sales beginning next year . after months of debate and political snags , the council approved rules to usher in commercial sales and cultivation set to begin in less than a month under an initiative approved by state voters .     california is among 29 states where pot is legal , either for medical or recreational use . medical marijuana has been legal in the state for two decades .     with the new year just weeks away -- and the holidays coming -- industry experts say it ' s not clear how many businesses , if any , will be ready to open their doors on jan. 1 to hordes of anxious customers .     under the los angeles regulations , residential neighborhoods would be largely off-limits to pot businesses , and buffer zones would be set up around schools , libraries and parks . \n\n<~end_element_marker~><~end_set_marker~>\n\nWrite a ~300 word

the federal government not making the needed repairs to the herbert hoover dike and florida can no longer afford to wait . because the obama administration has failed to act on this issue , the u.s. army corps of engineers continues to discharge millions of gallons of water into the st. lucie and caloosahatchee estuaries resulting in the growth of blue-green algae which is now entering
